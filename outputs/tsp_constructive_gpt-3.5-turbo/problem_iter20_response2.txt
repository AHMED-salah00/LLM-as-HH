Code description: The proposed algorithm aims to improve upon the previous algorithms by considering multiple factors and incorporating a more balanced approach to selecting the next node. The modified algorithm considers the current distance, destination distance, and the number of neighboring unvisited nodes for each unvisited node. It calculates a combined score for each unvisited node and selects the node with the highest combined score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the number of neighboring unvisited nodes for each unvisited node
    neighboring_nodes = set()
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighboring_nodes.update(np.where(distance_matrix[node] > 0)[0])
    neighboring_unvisited_nodes = neighboring_nodes.intersection(unvisited_nodes)
    neighbor_counts = np.array([len(np.where(distance_matrix[node] > 0)[0].tolist()) for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Calculate the combined score as the sum of current distances, destination distances, and neighbor counts
    combined_scores = current_distances + destination_distances + neighbor_counts
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
