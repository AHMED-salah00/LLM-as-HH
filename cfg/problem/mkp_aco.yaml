description: Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics". In a Multiple Knapsack Problem, you have items with multiple attributes (like weight, size, profit), and you want to select a subset of these items to maximize a specific objective while staying within certain limits for each attribute.
