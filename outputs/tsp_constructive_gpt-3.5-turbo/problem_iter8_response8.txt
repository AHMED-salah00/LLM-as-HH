Code description: 

In this code, I propose a modification to the original algorithm that takes into account not only the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, but also the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node. The modified algorithm balances these two factors to make a better decision for selecting the next node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the two factors
    score = current_distances - 0.5 * destination_distances
    
    # Find the node with the smallest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(score)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
In this modified algorithm, I remove the consideration of reachable unvisited nodes. Instead, I weigh the current distance and the destination distance differently by assigning a weight of 1 to the current distance and 0.5 to the destination distance. This reflects the importance of minimizing the current distance to ensure a good cycle and the importance of getting closer to the destination node. By modifying the weights, we can prioritize different factors to make a more informed decision about the next node to visit.
