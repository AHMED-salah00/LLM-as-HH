Code description: 
The code implements the Selective Sequential Insertion heuristic. This heuristic selects the next node to visit based on the distance from the current node to each unvisited node. The distance is weighted by the number of unvisited neighbors of each unvisited node. The node with the highest weighted distance is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using the Selective Sequential Insertion heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    n_nodes = len(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node
    unvisited_neighbors = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        unvisited_neighbors[node] = np.sum([1 for neighbor in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[node, neighbor] > 0])
    
    # Calculate the weighted distances from the current node to each unvisited node
    weighted_distances = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        weighted_distances[node] = distance_matrix[current_node, node] / unvisited_neighbors[node]
    
    # Select the node with the highest weighted distance as the next node to visit
    nxt_node = np.argmax(weighted_distances)
    
    return nxt_node
```
This code first calculates the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node. Then, it calculates the weighted distances from the current node to each unvisited node, where the distance is weighted by the number of unvisited neighbors. Finally, it selects the node with the highest weighted distance as the next node to visit.
