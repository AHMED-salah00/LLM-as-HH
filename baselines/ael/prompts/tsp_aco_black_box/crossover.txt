I have 2 algorithms for this task.
The first algorithm and the corresponding code is:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc1}
<Code>: {alg_code1}
The second algorithm and the corresponding code is
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc2}
<Code>: {alg_code2}

Please help me create a new algorithm that motivated by the given algorithms. Please provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The `heuristics` function takes as input a matrix of edge attributes and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input matrix.

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
