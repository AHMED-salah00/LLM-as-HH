Code description: The modified scoring function aims to improve the effectiveness of the heuristic measures by considering additional factors - the reverse distance, the number of connections of both source and destination nodes, and the centrality score of both source and destination nodes. The heuristic measure for each edge is calculated as the product of these factors. The heuristic measures are then normalized so that they sum up to 1.

import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the reverse distance matrix
    reverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, np.inf)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Initialize the node connections matrix
    node_connections = np.zeros(n_nodes, dtype=int)
    
    # Count the number of connections for each node
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        node_connections[i] = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix[i])
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
