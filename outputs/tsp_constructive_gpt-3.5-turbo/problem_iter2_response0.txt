Code description: In this modified algorithm, I propose a new approach to selecting the next node. Instead of considering only the minimum weighted distance, I will introduce a probabilistic element to the selection process. Each unvisited node will have a probability of being selected based on its weighted distance and the inverse of its degree centrality. By introducing randomness in the selection, we can explore alternative paths and potentially find better solutions.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
from typing import Tuple

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate degree centrality of all nodes
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(graph)

    # Calculate the weighted distances and probabilities for all unvisited nodes
    weighted_distances = {}
    total_weight = 0
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Calculate distance from the current node to the unvisited node
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]

        # Calculate distance from the destination node to the unvisited node
        dest_distance = distance_matrix[destination_node][node]

        # Calculate the weighted distance, where the distance is multiplied by the importance factor
        weighted_distance = distance * (1 / dest_distance) * degree_centrality[node]
        weighted_distances[node] = weighted_distance
        total_weight += weighted_distance

    # Normalize the weighted distances to probabilities
    probabilities = {}
    for node, weighted_distance in weighted_distances.items():
        probabilities[node] = weighted_distance / total_weight

    # Select the next node randomly based on the probabilities
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(list(probabilities.keys()), p=list(probabilities.values()))

    return nxt_node
```

In this modified algorithm, I calculate the weighted distance for each unvisited node by considering both the distance from the current node and the importance factor. The importance factor is calculated as the product of the inverse of the distance from the destination node and the node's degree centrality. Then, I normalize the weighted distances to obtain probabilities for each unvisited node. Finally, I select the next node randomly based on the probabilities. This introduces an element of exploration and increases the chances of finding better solutions.
