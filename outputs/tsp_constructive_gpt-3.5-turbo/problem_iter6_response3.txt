Code description: 

This code implements a novel selecting-next-node function called "Probabilistic Attraction". The function aims to balance exploration and exploitation by assigning attractions to the unvisited nodes based on a probabilistic approach. The algorithm calculates the attractiveness of each unvisited node by considering both the distance to the current node and the distance to the destination node. The function then selects the next node probabilistically by assigning probabilities to each unvisited node based on their attractiveness. The node with the highest probability is chosen as the next node to visit. By introducing probabilistic selection, the function enables exploration by allowing non-optimal nodes to be selected with a certain probability.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    exploration_factor = 0.5
    
    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix[current_node])
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_node = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node, destination_node]
        
        attractiveness[node] = 1 / (distance_to_node * distance_to_destination)
    
    # Normalize attractiveness values
    attractiveness /= np.sum(attractiveness)
    
    # Select the next node probabilistically based on attractiveness
    probabilities = attractiveness / np.sum(attractiveness)
    next_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probabilities)
    
    return next_node
```
