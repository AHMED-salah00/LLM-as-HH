Code description: 

The novel algorithm, called "Weighted Distance with Uncertainty, Degree, and Neighborhood Priority" (WDDNP), selects the next node to visit based on a weighted score that considers distance, uncertainty, degree, and the priority of unvisited neighbors. 

The algorithm first calculates the degree, uncertainty scores, and the priority of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node. The priority of unvisited neighbors is determined by the number of unvisited neighbors of the neighbors. A higher number of unvisited neighbors indicates a higher priority. 

The algorithm then calculates the weighted distances from the current node to each unvisited node, considering these factors. The node with the highest weighted distance is chosen as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
