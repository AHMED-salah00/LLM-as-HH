Code description: The proposed algorithm aims to incorporate a more balanced approach to selecting the next node by considering both the current distance and the destination distance for each unvisited node. Additionally, it introduces a novel factor that evaluates the connectivity of each unvisited node to the other unvisited nodes. By taking into account these factors, the algorithm aims to find a better next node that can lead to a more optimal solution.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the connectivity score for each unvisited node
    connectivity_scores = np.zeros(len(unvisited_nodes))
    for i, node in enumerate(unvisited_nodes):
        connectivity_scores[i] = np.mean(distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes)])
    
    # Calculate the combined score as a weighted sum of the current distance, destination distance, and connectivity score
    combined_scores = 0.4 * current_distances + 0.4 * destination_distances - 0.2 * connectivity_scores
    
    # Find the node with the smallest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

In this code, I first calculate the current distance and destination distance for each unvisited node using the given distance matrix. Then, I calculate the connectivity score for each unvisited node by averaging the distances between a node and all other unvisited nodes. The combined score is calculated as a weighted sum of the current distance, destination distance, and connectivity score. By assigning higher weights to the current and destination distances, the algorithm prioritizes nodes that are closer to the current node and the destination node. However, the connectivity score is used with a negative weight, which encourages the algorithm to select nodes that are more connected to the other unvisited nodes. Finally, I select the node with the smallest combined score as the next node to visit.
