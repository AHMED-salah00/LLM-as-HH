You begin by giving a concise and clear description of your code, followed by the code itself. **NOTE**: Your code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Some helpful tips:
- Strictly adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- You may sparsify the heuristic matrix by assigning a value of zero to unpromising solution components.
- Your scoring function outputs heuristic measures before solution construction. Therefore, NO information about partial solutions can be utilized.
