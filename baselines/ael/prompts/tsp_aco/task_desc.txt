Task: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. You should create a totally new `heuristics` function for me (different from the heuristics in the literature). The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (np.ndarray), and returns prior indicators (np.ndarray) of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.
