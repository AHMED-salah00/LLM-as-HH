Code description: 
I will introduce an improved scoring function that combines the measures from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. I will incorporate the degree centrality, edge importance, and connectivity information to create a more effective scoring function. By considering the importance of the nodes and their connectivity, the heuristic measures will capture the potential usefulness of each edge in the TSP instance.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.

    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the number of connections for each node
    node_degrees = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude self-loop
    
    # Create a graph from the distance matrix
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    
    # Compute the clustering coefficient of each node
    clustering_coefficient = np.array([nx.clustering(graph, node) for node in range(n_nodes)])

            connectivity[i, j] = 1 / ((degrees[i] + degrees[j]) * (common_neighbors + 1))
    
    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = edge_importance * degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis] * connectivity
    
    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```

This improved scoring function combines the degree centrality, edge importance, and connectivity information to determine the heuristic measures for each edge. The degree centrality captures the importance of each node in the graph, while the edge importance measures the significance of each edge based on the importance of its endpoints. The connectivity information reflects the connectedness between nodes. The heuristic measures are calculated by combining these measures and normalizing them.
