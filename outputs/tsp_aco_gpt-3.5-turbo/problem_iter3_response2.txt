Code description: In this combined algorithm, I propose to modify Algorithm 2 by incorporating the concept of node degree into the scoring function. The node degree represents the number of edges connected to each node. By considering both the hop count, centrality score, and node degree, we aim to improve the effectiveness of the scoring function in capturing local and global properties of the TSP instance.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count * edge_scores) / (edge_scores**2)
    
    # Calculate node degree
    node_degree = np.sum(distance_matrix <= (n_nodes-1), axis=1)
    
    # Multiply the node degree with heuristic measures
    heuristics *= node_degree[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
```
