Code description: 

I will modify the original scoring function to incorporate an additional factor, "distance_ratio", which represents how close the distance between two nodes is to the maximum distance in the distance matrix. This factor aims to penalize long distances between nodes and promote shorter distances in the solution. I will also adjust the weights for each factor to create a more balanced scoring function.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the demand factor
    clustering_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the clustering factor
    position_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the position factor
    depot_closeness_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the depot closeness factor
    closeness_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the closeness centrality factor
    angle_similarity_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the angle similarity factor
    distance_ratio_weight = 0.4  # Weight for the distance ratio factor

    # Calculate clustering factor
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])

    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i-1] == cluster_labels[j-1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = max_distance
                cluster_distances[j, i] = max_distance

    # Calculate closeness centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(G)

    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            position = (j - 1) / (n_nodes - 1)
            depot_closeness = distance_matrix[i, 0] + distance_matrix[j, 0]
            closeness = closeness_centrality[j]
            cluster_distance = cluster_distances[i, j]

            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio / max_demand
            normalized_position = position
            normalized_depot_closeness = depot_closeness / (2 * max_distance)
            normalized_closeness = closeness
            normalized_cluster_distance = cluster_distance / max_distance

            # Calculate angle similarity between edges i and j
            node_i_neighbors = np.where(distance_matrix[i] <= CAPACITY)[0]
            node_j_neighbors = np.where(distance_matrix[j] <= CAPACITY)[0]
            common_neighbors = len(np.intersect1d(node_i_neighbors, node_j_neighbors))
            angle_similarity = common_neighbors / min(len(node_i_neighbors), len(node_j_neighbors))

            distance_ratio = 1 - normalized_distance

            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = -1e9
            else:
                heuristics[i, j] = (
                    distance_weight * distance_ratio
                    + demand_weight * normalized_demand_ratio
                    + clustering_weight * np.exp(-normalized_cluster_distance)
                    + position_weight * normalized_position
                    + depot_closeness_weight * normalized_depot_closeness
                    + closeness_weight * normalized_closeness
                    + angle_similarity_weight * angle_similarity
                    + distance_ratio_weight * distance_ratio
                )

            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```

Note: The original code has been modified by introducing the "distance_ratio_weight" factor and adjusting the weights of other factors to create a more balanced scoring function. The "distance_ratio" factor penalizes long distances by subtracting the normalized distance value from 1. The weights have been adjusted to equally distribute the importance between the factors.
