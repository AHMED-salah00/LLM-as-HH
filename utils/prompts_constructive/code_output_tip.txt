Begin by giving a concise and clear description of your code, followed by the code itself. Your code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"
An example is given below:

Code description: This is a concise code description of your code.

```python
This is your Python code
```

Some helpful tips:
(1) Import necessary packages.
(2) You may introduce sophisticated mechanisms into the function if necessary.
(3) Do not modify the function signature.
(4) Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
(5) We only construct a solution once, so introducing stochasticity is not helpful.
(6) You DO NOT update the input variables. For example, you DO NOT remove the selected node from the unvisited nodes.
(6) Your code must do better than the algorithms that always act greedily. For example, DO NOT implement Nearest Neighbor heuristics.
