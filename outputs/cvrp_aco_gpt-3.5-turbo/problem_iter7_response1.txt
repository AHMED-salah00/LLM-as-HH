Code description: 
The provided code calculates heuristic measures for each edge in a distance matrix. It combines four factors: distance, demand, clustering, and depot proximity. The weights for these factors are set to balance their contributions to the heuristic measures. However, the weights and the use of clustering are not optimal. 

Improvements:
1. Adjust the weights of the factors to have a more balanced contribution to the heuristic measures.
2. Instead of using K-means clustering, use a distance-based clustering algorithm such as DBSCAN to better capture the spatial distribution of the nodes.
3. Consider the node distance from the depot in the clustering factor calculation.
4. Normalize the distances and demand ratios to ensure comparable scales of the factors.
5. Adjust the weights based on their relative importance.

Here is the modified code:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.3
    demand_weight = 0.3
    clustering_weight = 0.2
    depot_proximity_weight = 0.2

    # Distance factor
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    scaled_distances = scaler.fit_transform(distance_matrix)
    scaled_distances[scaled_distances == 0] = np.inf

    # Demand factor
    demand_ratio = demands[1:] / CAPACITY
    demand_ratio = demand_ratio.reshape(-1, 1)

    # Clustering factor
    dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.2, min_samples=3, metric='precomputed')
    cluster_labels = dbscan.fit_predict(scaled_distances[1:, 1:])
    cluster_distance_matrix = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i - 1] == cluster_labels[j - 1]:
                cluster_distance_matrix[i, j] = scaled_distances[i, j]
                cluster_distance_matrix[j, i] = scaled_distances[j, i]

    # Depot proximity factor
    depot_distances = scaled_distances[0, 1:]

    # Calculate heuristic measures
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = scaled_distances[i, j]
            demand = demand_ratio[j-1]
            cluster_distance = cluster_distance_matrix[i, j]
            depot_distance = depot_distances[j-1]

            inverted_distance = 1 / distance
            clustering_factor = 1 - cluster_distance
            depot_proximity_factor = 1 - depot_distance

            heuristics[i, j] = (
                distance_weight * inverted_distance
                + demand_weight * demand
                + clustering_weight * clustering_factor
                + depot_proximity_weight * depot_proximity_factor
            )

            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```

In the modified code, the weights of the factors have been adjusted to 0.3 for distance and demand, and 0.2 for clustering and depot proximity. The distance factor is normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure comparable scales. The demand factor is calculated as a ratio of demand to capacity. The clustering factor is based on DBSCAN clustering using the scaled distance matrix. The depot proximity factor is calculated by normalizing the depot distances.
