Code description: This code describes a novel selecting-next-node function for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function uses a concept similar to the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) but with some modifications. 

1) First, we initialize the current node as the starting node.
2) Then, we calculate the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes.
3) The next node is selected based on the highest distance from the current node. This is done to maximize the distance covered in each step and explore more regions of the problem space.
4) The selected next node is returned as the result.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node]
    max_distance = -1
    nxt_node = -1

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        if distances[node] > max_distance:
            max_distance = distances[node]
            nxt_node = node

    return nxt_node
```

Note: The code assumes that the distance matrix is already initialized with the appropriate distances between nodes. This code selects the next node based on the distance in the distance_matrix, rather than calculating the distances on the fly.
