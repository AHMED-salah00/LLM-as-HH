Code description: In this algorithm, I propose a new way to select the next node by considering both the attractiveness of each unvisited node and the distance between the current node and the unvisited node. Instead of using a fixed alpha and beta value for calculating attractiveness, I will dynamically adjust the values based on the number of remaining unvisited nodes. This will allow the algorithm to balance between exploration and exploitation based on the search space.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values

    # Calculate distances from current node to unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Normalize distances
    norm_distances = distances / np.max(distances)

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = (1 - norm_distances) + pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Calculate probability distribution for selecting the next node
    probabilities = attractiveness / np.sum(attractiveness)

    # Select next node based on probability distribution
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probabilities)

    return nxt_node
```
