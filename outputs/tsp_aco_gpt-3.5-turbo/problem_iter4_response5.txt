Code description: In this improved scoring function, I propose to modify the computation of node scores and incorporate the node degree from Algorithm 1 into the heuristic measures computation of Algorithm 2. By considering both the hop count and node degree, we aim to capture the local properties of the TSP instance effectively.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate node degree
    node_degree = np.sum(distance_matrix != np.inf, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores and node degree for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    edge_degree = np.repeat(node_degree[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge by combining hop count and node degree
    heuristics = (hop_count + 1) * edge_degree
    
    return heuristics
```

In this modified code, I have removed the computation of centrality score from Algorithm 2, as it doesn't provide any additional information when combined with the hop count. Instead, I have incorporated the node degree from Algorithm 1 into the heuristic measures computation. The node degree captures the connectivity of each node in the TSP instance, which can be useful in determining the importance of each edge. The heuristic measure for each edge is now calculated as the product of the hop count and the node degree, providing a better estimation of edge importance during the optimization process.
