Code description: 
The modified algorithm uses a novel selecting-next-node function for the TSP problem, which combines a distance-based strategy and a diversity-based strategy. The function calculates the pairwise distances between the current_node and all unvisited nodes, and also calculates the diversity of each unvisited node based on its proximity to other unvisited nodes. The function then selects the next_node by considering both the distance and diversity metrics. If there is more than one node with the minimum distance, the function selects the node with the maximum diversity value to promote diversity in the solution construction process.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distances between current_node and unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Sort nodes based on distances in ascending order
    sorted_nodes = np.argsort(distances)
    
    # Calculate the diversity metric for each node
    diversity_values = np.zeros(len(unvisited_nodes))
    for i, node in enumerate(unvisited_nodes):
        proximity = distance_matrix[node, sorted_nodes[:i+1]]
        diversity_values[i] = np.sum(proximity) / (i+1)**2
    
    # Find the nodes with the minimum distance
    min_distance_nodes = np.where(distances == np.min(distances))[0]
    
    # Select the node with the maximum diversity value among the nodes with minimum distance
    max_diversity_idx = np.argmax(diversity_values[min_distance_nodes])
    
    # Select the next_node based on distance and diversity metrics
    if len(min_distance_nodes) > 1:
        next_node = min_distance_nodes[max_diversity_idx]
    else:
        next_node = sorted_nodes[0]
    
    return next_node
```
