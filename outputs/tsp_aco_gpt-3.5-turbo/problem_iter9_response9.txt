Code description: The modified scoring function aims to improve the effectiveness of the heuristic measures by incorporating additional factors such as edge length variance, node centrality, and edge importance based on common neighbors. These factors provide insights into the distribution of edge lengths, the importance of each node within the graph, and the significance of an edge based on the number of common neighbors between the connected nodes.

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Returns

Note: The modified scoring function incorporates the edge length variance, node centrality, and edge importance based on common neighbors to provide a more effective measure of each edge's potential usefulness. The addition of these factors allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the edges, considering both local and global properties of the TSP instance.
