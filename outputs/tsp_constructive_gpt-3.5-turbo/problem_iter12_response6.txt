Code description: 
In this modified algorithm, we will introduce a new factor called "attractiveness" to guide the selection of the next node. The attractiveness will be calculated based on the distance to the node, the number of unvisited neighbors of the node, and the uncertainty score. The higher the attractiveness, the more likely the node will be selected as the next node to visit. However, instead of using a random choice among nodes with the maximum attractiveness, we will select the node with the highest attractiveness. This ensures that the selection is deterministic and avoids unnecessary randomness.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on trade-off between distance, uncertainty, and attractiveness.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.

    distances = distance_matrix[current_node]
    attractiveness_scores = []
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distances[node]
        variability = np.std(distance_matrix[:, node])
        neighbors = [neighbor for neighbor in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[node, neighbor] < np.inf]
        
        distance_score = 1 / distance
        uncertainty_score = variability / np.mean(distance_matrix[:, node])
