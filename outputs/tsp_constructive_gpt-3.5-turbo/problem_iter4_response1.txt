Code description: 
In this novel algorithm, we will select the next node based on both the distance and the degree of each unvisited node. We will calculate a weighted score for each unvisited node, where the score is determined by a weighted combination of distance and degree. The node with the highest weighted score will be selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the degree for each unvisited node
    degree = np.zeros(len(distance_matrix))
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        degree[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
    
    # Calculate the weighted score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        score = distance - 0.5 * degree[node]
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

In this algorithm, we first calculate the degree for each unvisited node by summing up the number of non-zero elements in the corresponding row of the distance matrix. Then, we calculate a weighted score for each unvisited node by subtracting half of the node's degree from the distance between the current node and that node. Finally, we select the node with the highest weighted score as the next node to visit.
