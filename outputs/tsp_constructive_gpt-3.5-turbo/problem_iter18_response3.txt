Code description: In this novel algorithm, I propose a modification to the original algorithm that takes into account both the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. The score is calculated based on a combination of these two distances, where the current distance has a higher weight than the destination distance.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate score for each unvisited node
    scores = current_distances - 0.5 * destination_distances
    
    # Find the node with the highest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

The proposed algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node by subtracting a weighted factor (0.5) times the distance from the destination node from the distance from the current node. The algorithm then selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. This modification aims to balance the importance of both distances in the decision-making process, allowing for better selection of the next node.
