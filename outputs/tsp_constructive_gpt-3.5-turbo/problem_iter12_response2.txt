Code description: 

The code implements a novel selecting-next-node function called "Balanced Distance First". This heuristic aims to balance the exploration of different parts of the solution space while also considering the overall distance. The idea is to prioritize unvisited nodes that are closer to both the current node and the destination node. This is achieved by calculating a score for each unvisited node that combines the distances from the current node and the destination node. The node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    scores = []
    
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to the unvisited nodes
    distances_to_unvisited = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the unvisited nodes to the destination node
    distances_to_destination = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, destination_node]
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Find the index of the unvisited node
        node_index = list(unvisited_nodes).index(node)
        
        # Calculate the score by combining the distances from the current node and the destination node
        score = (distances_to_unvisited[node_index] + distances_to_destination[node_index]) / 2
        
        # Append the score to the list of scores
        scores.append(score)
    
    # Find the index of the unvisited node with the highest score
    max_index = np.argmax(scores)
    
    # Get the actual unvisited node corresponding to the maximum index
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[max_index]
    
    return nxt_node
```
