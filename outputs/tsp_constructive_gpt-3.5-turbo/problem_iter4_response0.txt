Code description: In this code, I will design a novel selecting-next-node function using a combination of the two given algorithms. The goal is to select the next node that minimizes the distance to both the current node and the destination node, while also considering the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels.

I will start by calculating the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes, the distances from the destination node to all unvisited nodes, and the distance from the current node to the destination node. 

Next, I will calculate the weighted distances, which is the sum of the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes and the distances from the destination node to those unvisited nodes. This captures both the distance from the current node and the distance to the destination node.

Then, I will calculate the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels. The attractiveness will be inversely proportional to the pheromone levels. 

After that, I will calculate the combined score for each unvisited node by dividing the attractiveness by the weighted distances. This will give a score that takes into account both the distance and attractiveness.

Finally, I will select the unvisited node with the maximum combined score as the next node to visit and return it as the output of the function.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.

    # Calculate the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the destination node to all unvisited nodes
    dest_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to the destination node
    dest_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes added to the distance from the destination node to those unvisited nodes
    weighted_distances = distances + dest_distances
    
    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels
    alpha = 1.0
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values
    attractiveness = np.exp(-alpha * pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)])

    # Calculate the combined attractiveness and weighted distance score for each unvisited node
    combined_score = attractiveness / weighted_distances
    
    # Find the index of the unvisited node with the maximum combined score
    max_index = np.argmax(combined_score)
    
    # Get the corresponding unvisited node
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[max_index]
    
    return nxt_node
