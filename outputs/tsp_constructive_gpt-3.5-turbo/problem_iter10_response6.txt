Code description: The proposed algorithm combines elements from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It takes into account the distance to the node, the number of unvisited neighbors, the degree, and the uncertainty score. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node using these factors and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    n_nodes = len(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node
    num_unvisited_neighbors = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        num_unvisited_neighbors[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
    
    # Calculate the degree for each unvisited node
    degree = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        degree[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
    
    # Calculate the uncertainty scores for each unvisited node
    uncertainty_scores = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        variability = np.std(distance_matrix[:, node])
        uncertainty_scores[node] = variability
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        score = distance - 0.5 * num_unvisited_neighbors[node] + 0.5 * degree[node] * uncertainty_scores[node]
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
