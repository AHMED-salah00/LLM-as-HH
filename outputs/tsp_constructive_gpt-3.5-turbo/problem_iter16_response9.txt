Code description: In this code, I propose a new selecting-next-node function called "Probabilistic Degree-Biased Exploration". This heuristic builds upon the degree-biased exploration strategy by introducing probabilistic selection based on node degree centrality. Instead of selecting the node with the highest degree centrality every time, we assign probabilities to each unvisited node based on their degree centrality values. This allows for exploration of less connected nodes as well, while still prioritizing nodes with higher degree centrality.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Compute the sum of degree centrality values for unvisited nodes
    sum_degree = sum([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Generate a random number to determine the selected node
    r = random.random()
    
    # Calculate cumulative probabilities based on degree centrality
    cum_prob = 0
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        prob = degree_centralities[node] / sum_degree
        cum_prob += prob
        
        if r <= cum_prob:
            nxt_node = node
            break
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: In this modified code, I've added functionality to compute probabilities for each unvisited node based on their degree centrality values. I've also introduced a cumulative probability calculation and a random number comparison to probabilistically select the next node.
