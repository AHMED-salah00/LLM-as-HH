Code description: The current code uses a combination of factors including proximity to the current node, distance to the destination node, and number of unvisited neighbors to select the next node. However, it does not consider the possibility of reaching a dead end where there are no unvisited neighbors. To address this, we can modify the code to prioritize nodes with a higher number of unvisited neighbors only if they are not dead ends. We can also add a penalty factor for nodes that are closer to the destination, to encourage exploration of nodes that are farther away.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
