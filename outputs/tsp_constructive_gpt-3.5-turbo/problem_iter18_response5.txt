Code description: In this improved version, I propose a novel selecting-next-node function called "Modified Probabilistic Degree-Biased Exploration". This heuristic combines the probabilistic selection based on node degree centrality from Algorithm 1 with the distance-based selection from Algorithm 2. The aim is to balance the exploration of less connected nodes with the consideration of direct distances and modified greedy squeezing distance. By incorporating both aspects, we can potentially find a better node to visit that balances both local and global information.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Compute the sum of degree centrality values for unvisited nodes
    sum_degree = sum([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate cumulative probabilities based on degree centrality
    cum_prob = 0
    prob_dist = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        prob = degree_centralities[node] / sum_degree
        prob_dist[node] = prob
        cum_prob += prob
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        scores[node] = prob_dist[node] + 0.4 * direct_distances[node] - 0.3 * destination_distances[node] + 0.3 * mgs_distance[node]
    
    # Find the node with the highest score
    nxt_node = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    
    return nxt_node
```
