Code description: 
In this improved algorithm, I will use a combination of the Random Selection heuristic and the Greedy Strategy. The algorithm will randomly select a small subset of nodes from the unvisited nodes, calculate the distance from the current node to each of these nodes, and then select the node with the shortest distance.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using an improved heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Select a random subset of nodes from the unvisited nodes
    subset_nodes = random.sample(unvisited_nodes, k=min(5, len(unvisited_nodes)))
    
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to each node in the subset
    distances = [(node, distance_matrix[current_node][node]) for node in subset_nodes]
    
    # Sort the nodes based on the distance
    distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Select the node with the shortest distance
    nxt_node = distances[0][0]
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: In this improved algorithm, I randomly select a subset of nodes from the unvisited nodes to consider for selection. This adds a degree of randomness to the algorithm while still ensuring a high probability of selecting a node with a short distance. Additionally, by only considering a small subset of nodes, the algorithm will have a lower computational complexity compared to considering all the unvisited nodes.
