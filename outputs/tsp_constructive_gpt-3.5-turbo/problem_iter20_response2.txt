Code description: In this algorithm, we will modify the selection process to consider multiple factors including the improvement in path length, the distance to the destination node, and the number of unvisited neighbors. By combining these factors using weighted scores, we can select a node that balances all these considerations.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    weight1 = 0.3  # Weight for improvement in path length
    weight2 = 0.3  # Weight for distance to destination node
    weight3 = 0.4  # Weight for number of unvisited neighbors
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        current_distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        destination_distance = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        improvement = current_distance + destination_distance - distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        score = weight1 * improvement + weight2 * (1 / (destination_distance+1)) + weight3 * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
