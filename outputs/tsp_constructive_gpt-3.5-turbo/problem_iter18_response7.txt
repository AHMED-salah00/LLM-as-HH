Code description: The proposed algorithm aims to incorporate a more comprehensive approach to selecting the next node by considering multiple factors. The modified algorithm considers the current distance, destination distance, and the number of neighboring unvisited nodes for each unvisited node. The algorithm calculates a combined score for each unvisited node and selects the node with the highest combined score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the number of neighboring unvisited nodes for each unvisited node
    neighboring_nodes = set()
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighboring_nodes.update(np.where(distance_matrix[node] > 0)[0])
    neighboring_unvisited_nodes = neighboring_nodes.intersection(unvisited_nodes)
    neighbor_counts = np.array([len(np.where(distance_matrix[node] > 0)[0].tolist()) for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Calculate the combined score as the sum of the reciprocal of current and destination distances, multiplied by the neighbor counts
    combined_scores = (1 / current_distances) + (1 / destination_distances) + neighbor_counts
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
- In this modified algorithm, the combined score is calculated as the sum of the reciprocal of the current and destination distances, multiplied by the neighbor counts. This modification aims to give more weight to nodes that are closer to both the current and destination nodes and have fewer neighboring unvisited nodes.
- The node with the highest combined score is selected as the next node to visit. This approach aims to prioritize nodes that have a favorable combination of distance factors and fewer neighboring unvisited nodes.
