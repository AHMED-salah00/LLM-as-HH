Code description: In this modified algorithm, I will implement a heuristic called "Weighted Minimum Distance to Nearest Unvisited Node". Instead of selecting the next node solely based on the minimum distance, I will introduce a weight factor that takes into account the distance as well as the number of unvisited nodes reachable from that node. The idea is to prioritize nodes that not only have a shorter distance but also have more unvisited nodes nearby, as they have the potential to cover more nodes in the path.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on the weighted minimum distance to the nearest unvisited node.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    min_distance = np.inf # Initialize the minimum distance to infinity
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Iterate over unvisited nodes and calculate the weighted distance
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        unvisited_neighbor_nodes = set()
        
        # Find the neighbors of the current node that are unvisited
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if distance_matrix[node, neighbor] != 0:
                unvisited_neighbor_nodes.add(neighbor)
        
        # Calculate the weighted distance based on the distance and the number of unvisited neighbors
        weighted_distance = distance / len(unvisited_neighbor_nodes)
        
        # Update the minimum distance and the next node if a better choice is found
        if weighted_distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = weighted_distance
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

This modified algorithm determines the next node to visit based on the weighted minimum distance to the nearest unvisited node. It calculates the weighted distance for each unvisited node by dividing the distance between the current node and the unvisited node by the number of unvisited nodes reachable from that node. By incorporating both distance and reachability, this modified algorithm aims to select nodes that not only have a shorter distance but also offer the potential to cover more unvisited nodes in the remaining path.
