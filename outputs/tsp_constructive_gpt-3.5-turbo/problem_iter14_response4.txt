Code description: In this new algorithm, we will introduce a new factor to the score calculation that considers the ratio of the distance between the current node and the destination node to the total distance of the route. This factor aims to prioritize visiting nodes that are closer to the destination node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on uncertainty, distance, number of unvisited neighbors,
    degree, and distance ratio to the destination node.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
