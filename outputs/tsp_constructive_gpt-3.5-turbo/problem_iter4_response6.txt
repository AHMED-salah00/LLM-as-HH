Code description: The algorithm I propose is based on the concept of selecting the next node based on the ratio of the pheromone level to the distance to each unvisited node. 

The idea is to prioritize the nodes with higher pheromone levels and shorter distances, as they are more likely to lead to a better solution. The algorithm calculates the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on this ratio and selects the node with the highest attractiveness as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)] / distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Select next node with the highest attractiveness
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(attractiveness)]

    return nxt_node
```
