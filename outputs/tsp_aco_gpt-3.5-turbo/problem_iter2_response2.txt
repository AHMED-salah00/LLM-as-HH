Code description: 

In this modified algorithm, I propose to combine the hop count measure from Algorithm 1 with the centrality score measure from Algorithm 2 to create a more effective scoring function. The hop count measure takes into account the number of edges between nodes, emphasizing edges that connect nodes that are closer in terms of hops. The centrality score measure considers the sum of distances to other nodes, highlighting edges that are more central in the network. By combining these two measures, we aim to capture both local and global properties of the TSP instance, resulting in a more informed scoring function.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count) / edge_scores
    
    # Calculate edge centrality score
    centrality_score = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)
    
    # Multiply the centrality score with heuristic measures
    heuristics *= centrality_score[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
```
