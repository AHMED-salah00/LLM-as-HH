Code description: 
The code below implements a novel selecting-next-node function called "Minimum Traversal Time." The idea behind this heuristic is to select the node that minimizes the total traversal time, taking into account both the distance and the time required to visit the node. The function first calculates the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes. Then, for each unvisited node, it calculates the time required to visit the node based on a given traversal speed. Finally, it selects the node with the minimum total traversal time as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Define the traversal speed (distance per unit time)
    traversal_speed = 1
    
    # Calculate distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the time required to visit each unvisited node
    visit_times = distances / traversal_speed
    
    # Calculate the total traversal time for each unvisited node
    traversal_times = distances + visit_times
    
    # Select the node with the minimum total traversal time
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(traversal_times)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
