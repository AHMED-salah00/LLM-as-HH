Code description: In this code, I will propose a new algorithm to select the next node based on a combination of a greedy approach and the use of edge weights. The goal is to select the next node that maximizes the ratio between the edge weight and the distance to the destination node.

I will start by initializing the next node variable (nxt_node) to None and the maximum ratio variable (max_ratio) to negative infinity. Then, I will iterate through all unvisited nodes to calculate the ratio for each node using the edge weight and the distance to the destination node. If the calculated ratio is larger than the maximum ratio found so far, I will update the maximum ratio and assign the unvisited node as the next node to visit.

Finally, I will return the next node as the output of the function.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    nxt_node = None
    max_ratio = float('-inf')
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        edge_weight = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_to_dest = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        ratio = edge_weight / distance_to_dest

        if ratio > max_ratio:
            max_ratio = ratio
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: This algorithm aims to prioritize edges with high weights, as they may indicate important connections. The ratio between the edge weight and the distance to the destination node allows for a balanced selection considering both the edge weight and the overall path length.
