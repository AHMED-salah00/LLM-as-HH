Code description: 

This code modifies the original algorithm by introducing a novel way to select the next node based on a combination of criteria. In addition to considering the distance from the current node and the destination node to each unvisited node, this modified algorithm also takes into account the average distance of unvisited nodes to their neighboring unvisited nodes. 

The modified algorithm assigns weights to each of these criteria and calculates a combined score for each unvisited node. The weights are as follows:
- 50% weight for the distance from the current node to each unvisited node.
- 30% weight for the average distance of unvisited nodes to their neighboring unvisited nodes.
- 20% weight for the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node.

The node with the highest combined score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Neighbor Distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.5 * current_distances + 0.3 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values())) - 0.2 * destination_distances
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
