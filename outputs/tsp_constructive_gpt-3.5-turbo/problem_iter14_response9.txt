Code description: In this code, I propose a novel algorithm that selects the next node based on a combination of the Modified Greedy Squeezing (MGS) distance, the distance from the current node to the destination node, and the density of unvisited nodes in the vicinity of each node. The goal is to choose a node that not only has a balance between being close to the current node and the destination node, but also considers the density of unvisited nodes nearby.

First, we calculate the MGS distance for each unvisited node as described in Algorithm 1.

Next, we calculate the density of unvisited nodes in the vicinity of each unvisited node. The density is determined by counting the number of unvisited nodes within a certain radius of each node.

Then, we calculate the score for each unvisited node by multiplying the MGS distance, the inverse of the distance from the current node to the destination node, and the density of unvisited nodes. This score reflects the balance between the MGS distance, the direct distance to the destination node, and the density of unvisited nodes nearby.

Finally, we select the node with the highest score as the next node to visit and return it.
