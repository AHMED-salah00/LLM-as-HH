Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will modify Algorithm 1 by considering the weight coefficients for distance, demand, and remaining capacity as user-defined parameters. Additionally, I will incorporate the demand ratio as a factor in the heuristic measure, which represents the ratio of the demand of the next node to the remaining capacity of the vehicle.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int, distance_weight: float, demand_weight: float, capacity_weight: float) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Initialize heuristics matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Set a very large number for diagonal elements of distance matrix
    np.fill_diagonal(distance_matrix, np.inf)

    # Calculate heuristic measures for each edge
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(i+1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_sum = demands[i] + demands[j]
            remaining_cap = CAPACITY - (demands[i] + demands[j])
            demand_ratio = max(demands[j] / remaining_cap, 0)

            # Calculate heuristic measure
            heuristics[i, j] = (distance_weight * distance) + (demand_weight * demand_sum) + (capacity_weight * demand_ratio)

    # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
    heuristics += np.tril(heuristics.T, -1)
    
    return heuristics
```

Note: The weight coefficients for distance, demand, and capacity are user-defined parameters in this modified scoring function, allowing the users to assign more or less importance to different factors based on their specific requirements.
