Code description: The proposed crossover algorithm combines the advantages of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It incorporates the dynamic weights adjustment and modified Greedy Squeezing distance from Algorithm 1, and also considers the direct distance, destination distance, and neighbor distance measures from Algorithm 2. Additionally, it introduces a new measure called Edge Weight Distance, which represents the average distance between the current node and its neighboring unvisited nodes. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node, considering all these factors, and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate Neighbor Distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate Edge Weight Distance for each unvisited node
    edge_weight_distances = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        edge_weight_distances[node] = np.mean(distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes & set(distance_matrix[node]))])
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.3 * direct_distances + 0.3 * destination_distances + 0.2 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.1 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values())) + 0.1 * np.array(list(edge_weight_distances.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
