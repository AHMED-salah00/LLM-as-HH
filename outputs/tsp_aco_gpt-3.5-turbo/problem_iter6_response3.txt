Code description: 
To design a better scoring function, I will take elements from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. Specifically, I will incorporate the node scores, hop count, node degree, and edge centrality measures. This combined approach aims to capture both local and global properties of the TSP instance, providing a more comprehensive assessment of each edge's potential usefulness.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.
