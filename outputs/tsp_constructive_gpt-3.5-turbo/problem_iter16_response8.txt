Code description: The current code uses a combination of different measures to calculate a score for each unvisited node and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. However, the current code can be improved to consider additional factors that can lead to a better selection of the next node. 

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate Neighbor Distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - {node})]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate the weights based on the progress towards the destination node
    progress = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)] / (distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node] + distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)])
    weights = 0.8 * progress + 0.2 * (1 - progress)
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.4 * direct_distances + 0.3 * destination_distances + 0.3 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.2 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values())) + 0.6 * weights
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

Improved Algorithm:

In the improved algorithm, I will introduce a new factor called "Return Distance". This distance measures the distance from each unvisited node back to the destination node. The motivation behind introducing this factor is that sometimes it's beneficial to select nodes that are closer to the destination node on the return path, as they may lead to shorter overall tour lengths.

Here are the steps to modify the code:

1. Calculate the return distances from each unvisited node to the destination node.
2. Calculate the weights based on the progress towards the destination node as before.
3. Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node, considering all the factors: direct distances, destination distances, modified greedy squeezing distances, neighbor distances, and return distances.
4. Find the node with the highest combined score and return it as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate Neighbor Distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - {node})]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate the weights based on the progress towards the destination node
    progress = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)] / (distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node] + distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)])
    weights = 0.8 * progress + 0.2 * (1 - progress)
    
    # Calculate Return Distance for each unvisited node
    return_distance = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes), destination_node]
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.35 * direct_distances + 0.25 * destination_distances + 0.25 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.1 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values())) + 0.05 * weights + 0.05 * return_distance
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
