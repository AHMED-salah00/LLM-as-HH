Code description:

My approach is to select the next node based on a combination of the minimum distance from the current_node and the distance from the destination_node. However, I will introduce an additional parameter called "importance" which indicates the importance of each node. The importance of a node is calculated as the product of its distance from the current_node and its distance from the destination_node. This approach aims to minimize the total distance traveled while also prioritizing nodes that are important in terms of their distance from both current_node and destination_node.

Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize minimum combined distance and selected node
    min_combined_distance = np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Iterate through all unvisited nodes
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Calculate distance from the current node to the unvisited node
        distance_from_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        
        # Calculate distance from the destination node to the unvisited node
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
        
        # Calculate importance of the node
        importance = distance_from_current * distance_to_destination
        
        # Calculate combined distance
        combined_distance = distance_from_current + distance_to_destination
        
        # Update minimum combined distance and selected node if a smaller combined distance is found
        if combined_distance < min_combined_distance or (combined_distance == min_combined_distance and importance < min_importance):
            min_combined_distance = combined_distance
            min_importance = importance
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
This modified algorithm considers both the distance from the current_node to the unvisited_node and the distance from the destination_node to the unvisited_node. The node with the minimum combined distance is selected as the next node to visit. In case of a tie, the node with the minimum importance (calculated as the product of distance_from_current and distance_to_destination) will be selected.
