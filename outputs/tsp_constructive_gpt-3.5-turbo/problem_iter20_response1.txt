Code description: My code implements a novel selecting-next-node function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function uses the concept of pheromones inspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to guide the selection of the next node. 

The algorithm starts by initializing a pheromone matrix with small positive values. Then, for each unvisited node, the algorithm calculates a selection probability for each node using the pheromone intensities and the distance to the current node. The selection probability is calculated by exponentiating the product of the pheromone intensity and the inverse of the distance. The node with the highest selection probability is chosen as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    pheromone_matrix = np.ones_like(distance_matrix) * 0.01  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values
    
    # Calculate the selection probabilities for each unvisited node
    selection_probabilities = []
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        pheromone_intensity = pheromone_matrix[current_node, node]
        selection_probability = np.exp(pheromone_intensity / distance)
        selection_probabilities.append(selection_probability)
    
    # Normalize the selection probabilities
    selection_probabilities = selection_probabilities / np.sum(selection_probabilities)
    
    # Select the node with the highest selection probability
    nxt_node = np.argmax(selection_probabilities)
    
    return nxt_node
```
