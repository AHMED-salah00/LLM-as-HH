Code description: In this algorithm, we aim to select the next node based on both the distance and the number of unvisited neighbors. However, instead of using a weighted average, we will introduce a trade-off parameter that determines the relative importance of distance and unvisited neighbors. 

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    trade_off = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        # Distance score
        distance_score = distance / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        # Number of unvisited neighbors score
        neighbors_score = num_unvisited_neighbors / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        # Calculate the weighted score
        score = trade_off * distance_score + (1 - trade_off) * neighbors_score
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
