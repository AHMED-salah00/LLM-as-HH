You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. You are going to design <novel> heuristics to solve optimization problems as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a novel static scoring function. The function outputs heuristic measures indicating how good is each edge before actually solving a problem instance. You also concisely describe your code before writing it.
The function signature is as follows:

-----

{func_signature}
