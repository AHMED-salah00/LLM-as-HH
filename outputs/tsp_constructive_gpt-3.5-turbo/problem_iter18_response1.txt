Code description: The crossover algorithm selects the next node based on both the distance to the node and the number of unvisited neighbors. However, it introduces a random element by considering multiple nodes with the highest score and randomly selecting one of them. To improve upon this, I will modify the scoring function to prioritize nodes that are closer to the destination node rather than the current node. This will encourage the algorithm to move towards the destination more efficiently.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    max_score_nodes = []
    weight1 = 0.5
    weight2 = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        score = weight1 * (1 / distance_to_destination) - weight2 * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            max_score_nodes = [node]
        elif score == max_score:
            max_score_nodes.append(node)
    
    # Randomly select one of the nodes with the highest score
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(max_score_nodes)
    
    return nxt_node
```
