Suppose `n` indicates the scale of the problem, `m` is the dimension of constraints. The constraint of each dimension is fixed to `n//2`. The `heuristics` function takes as input a prize array with n entries, a weight array shaped (n,m), and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include the next item in a solution. The result shall have the shape (n,n).
