Begin by giving a concise and clear description of your code, followed by the code itself.
Enclose your code in triple backticks like this: "```python ... ```"

Overall, your output follows the below format delimited by triple dashes:

---

Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- We only construct a solution once, so introducing stochasticity is not helpful.
- You must keep the input variables unchanged. For example, ensure the selected node remains within the unvisited nodes.
- You must focus on developing novel algorithms instead of relying on classic and greedy ones. For example, avoid using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
