Code description: 
This improved scoring function aims to take into account factors such as distance, demand, clustering, and demand density to assign heuristic measures to edges. In addition to these factors, it includes a penalty for edges that exceed the vehicle capacity. The weights of each factor are adjusted to optimize their contribution to the heuristic measures.

In this improved scoring function, the weights for each factor have been adjusted to optimize their contribution to the heuristic measures. The distance weight has been reduced to 0.35, the demand weight to 0.15, the clustering weight to 0.2, the demand density weight to 0.3, and a capacity penalty weight has been added with a weight of 0.2. The capacity penalty is calculated as the excess demand (if any) divided by the maximum demand, and is subtracted from the total heuristic measure for an edge.
