Code description: 

The proposed code uses the Randomized Edge Selection algorithm as a basis, but introduces a modification to improve the exploration of less promising nodes in a probabilistic manner. Instead of inversely proportional probabilities based on distance, the proposed code calculates the probabilities as a power of the inverse of the distance. This modification allows for a more flexible weighting of the probabilities, giving the algorithm a greater ability to explore different nodes. The parameter alpha determines the power to which the inverse of the distance is raised, allowing for fine-tuning of the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray, alpha: float) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using a modified Randomized Edge Selection algorithm.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    alpha : float
        The power to which the inverse of the distance is raised to calculate the probabilities.
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the probabilities of selecting each unvisited node
    probabilities = 1 / distances
    probabilities = np.power(probabilities, alpha)
    
    # Normalize the probabilities
    probabilities /= np.sum(probabilities)
    
    # Select the next node randomly based on the probabilities
    nxt_node = random.choices(list(unvisited_nodes), probabilities)[0]
    
    return nxt_node
