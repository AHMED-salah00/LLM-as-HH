Code description: This code aims to improve the selecting-next-node function by considering both the direct distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node. The next node is selected based on a weighted combination of these factors, with a preference for nodes that are closer to both the current node and the destination node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.7 * direct_distances + 0.3 * destination_distances
    
    # Find the node with the lowest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
In this code, we calculate the direct distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node using the provided distance matrix. We assign weights of 0.7 to the direct distances and 0.3 to the destination distances, and calculate the combined score for each unvisited node. The next node to visit is selected as the node with the lowest combined score, indicating that it is both close to the current node and the destination node.
