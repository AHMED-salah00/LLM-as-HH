Code description: 
To improve the scoring function, I propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of both algorithms. My approach considers both the distance between nodes and the hop count. The hop count gives preference to edges that connect nodes that are closer in terms of hops, while the distance factor ensures that shorter edges are prioritized. 

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Combine the inverse distances, hop count, and average distance of connected nodes
    heuristics = inverse_distance_matrix + (hop_count / edge_scores) + connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis]
    
    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```
