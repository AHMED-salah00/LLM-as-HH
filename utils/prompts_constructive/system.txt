You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. You are going to design <novel> heuristics to solve optimization problems as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a novel selecting-next-node function for the solution construction process. The function determines which node to visit at each time step. You also concisely describe your code before writing it.
The function signature is as follows:

-----

{func_signature}
