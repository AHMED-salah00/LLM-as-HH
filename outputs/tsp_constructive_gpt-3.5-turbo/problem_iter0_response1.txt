Code description: 
In this code, I will design a novel selecting-next-node function for the TSP. The function will select the next node to visit based on a combination of the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes. The function will prioritize visiting nodes that have a shorter distance from the current node and are closer to the average distance of all unvisited nodes.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).

    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Compute the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes
    avg_distances = np.mean(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=1)
    
    # Compute the distance from the current node to each unvisited node
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate a score for each unvisited node based on the combination of distances
    scores = distances / avg_distances * distances
    
    # Select the node with the highest score as the next node to visit
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
