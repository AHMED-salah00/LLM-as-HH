Code description: In this modified algorithm, we will introduce a new factor called "urgency" to guide the selection of the next node. The urgency will be calculated based on the distance to the node and the number of unvisited neighbors of the node. The higher the urgency, the more likely the node will be selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_urgency = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the urgency for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        if node != current_node:
            distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
            neighbors = [neigh for neigh in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[node, neigh] < np.inf]
            urgency = distance / len(neighbors)
            
            if urgency > max_urgency:
                max_urgency = urgency
                nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
