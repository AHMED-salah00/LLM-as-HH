You begin by giving a concise and clear description of your code, followed by the code itself. **NOTE**: Your code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Some helpful tips:
- Strictly adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- We only construct a solution once, so try better designs than introducing stochasticity.
- You write novel algorithms instead of using classic and greedy ones. For example, do NOT write Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
