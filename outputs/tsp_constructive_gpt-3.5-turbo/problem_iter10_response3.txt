Code description: The following code implements a selecting-next-node function for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a novel heuristic called "Minimizing Edge Ratio". 

The algorithm iteratively selects the next node to visit based on the ratio between the distance and the number of unvisited nodes that can be reached from the current node. It chooses the node with the minimum edge ratio to the current node. This approach aims to minimize the total distance traveled in the TSP tour while prioritizing nodes with more reachable unvisited nodes.

The code calculates the ratio between the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the number of reachable unvisited nodes from that node. It then selects the node with the minimum ratio as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    min_edge_ratio = float('inf')
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Find the node with the minimum edge ratio
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        reachable_nodes = np.sum(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes),:], axis=1)[node]
        edge_ratio = distance / reachable_nodes
        
        if edge_ratio < min_edge_ratio:
            min_edge_ratio = edge_ratio
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

The above code introduces a novel heuristic called "Minimizing Edge Ratio". Instead of solely prioritizing the distance between the current node and each unvisited node, it takes into account the number of unvisited nodes that can be reached from each unvisited node. By minimizing the edge ratio, the algorithm aims to achieve a trade-off between minimizing distance and maximizing the opportunities for future visits.
