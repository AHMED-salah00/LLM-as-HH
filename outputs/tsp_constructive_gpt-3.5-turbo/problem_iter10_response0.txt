Code description: In this code, I propose a modification to the select_next_node function that incorporates a new factor in the scoring function. This factor takes into account the degree centrality of each unvisited node. Degree centrality measures how connected a node is to the rest of the nodes in the graph. By considering this factor, we aim to select nodes that are not only close in distance but also well-connected to the rest of the nodes.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the three factors
    score = current_distances - 0.5 * destination_distances + 0.2 * np.array([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Find the node with the smallest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(score)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

The code calculates the current distance and destination distance from the current node to each unvisited node. It then calculates the degree centrality for each unvisited node using the distance matrix. Finally, it combines the distance factors with the degree centrality factor using a weighted sum and selects the node with the smallest score as the next node to visit.

The modification is to replace the closeness centrality factor with the degree centrality factor. This aims to select nodes that not only have short distances but are also well-connected to the rest of the nodes.
