Code description: 
The crossover algorithm selects the next node to visit based on a combination of the Selective Sequential Insertion heuristic and the novel algorithm. It calculates the weighted distance from the current node to each unvisited node using the Selective Sequential Insertion heuristic, and then combines it with the metric value calculated based on the distance from the current node to the unvisited nodes and the distance from the unvisited nodes to the destination node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes by combining the Selective Sequential Insertion heuristic and the novel algorithm.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
