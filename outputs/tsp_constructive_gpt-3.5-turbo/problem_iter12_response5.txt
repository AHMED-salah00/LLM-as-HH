Code description: In this code, I propose a novel selecting-next-node function that incorporates a combination of factors to determine the next node to visit. The function considers both the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from each unvisited node to the destination node. Additionally, it takes into account the degree centrality of each unvisited node to prioritize well-connected nodes.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the three factors
    score = current_distances - 0.5 * destination_distances + 0.2 * np.array([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Find the node with the smallest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(score)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

This code combines the factors used in both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It calculates the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from each unvisited node to the destination node. It also calculates the degree centrality for each unvisited node. The final score is calculated as a weighted sum of the current distances, destination distances, and degree centralities.

By incorporating these factors, the function aims to select the next node that is not only close in distance but also well-connected to the rest of the nodes in the graph.
