Code description: The code aims to improve the selecting-next-node function by introducing a novel algorithm that utilizes a combination of the Modified Greedy Squeezing (MGS) distance, the distance from the current node to the destination node, and the degree centrality of the unvisited nodes.

The algorithm first calculates the MGS distance for each unvisited node by dividing the direct distance from the current node to the destination node by the product of the distance from the current node to the unvisited node and the number of neighboring unvisited nodes.

It then calculates a score for each unvisited node by combining the MGS distance, the distance from the current node to the destination node, and the degree centrality. The score aims to balance closeness to the current node, connectivity, and distance to the destination node.

Finally, the algorithm selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit and returns it.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.7 * current_distances + 0.3 * destination_distances + 0.4 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.1 * np.array([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
