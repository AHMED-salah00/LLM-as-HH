Code description: In this modified algorithm, I propose to incorporate a probabilistic element in the selection of the next node. This probabilistic approach allows for exploring different nodes based on their scores, rather than selecting the node with the highest score deterministically.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    scores = []
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_current_node = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_destination_node = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        distance_current_node_norm = distance_current_node / np.max(distance_matrix)
        distance_destination_node_norm = distance_destination_node / np.max(distance_matrix)
        neighbors_norm = num_unvisited_neighbors / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        score = distance_current_node_norm + distance_destination_node_norm + neighbors_norm
        scores.append(score)
    
    # Calculate the probabilities based on scores
    probabilities = np.array(scores) / sum(scores)
    
    # Select the next node probabilistically
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probabilities)
    
    return nxt_node
```

This modified algorithm introduces randomness in the selection of the next node by calculating probabilities based on the scores of each unvisited node. The probability of selecting a particular node is proportional to its score. This approach allows for exploring different nodes with high scores rather than always selecting the node with the highest score.
