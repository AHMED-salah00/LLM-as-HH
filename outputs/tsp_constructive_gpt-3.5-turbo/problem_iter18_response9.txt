Code description: In this algorithm, we aim to select the next node based on a combination of distance and the number of unvisited neighbors. We calculate a score for each unvisited node by multiplying the inverse of the distance and the number of unvisited neighbors. This scoring method gives higher weight to nodes with shorter distances and a higher number of unvisited neighbors. We select the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        # Calculate the score as the product of inverse distance and number of unvisited neighbors
        score = 1 / distance * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
