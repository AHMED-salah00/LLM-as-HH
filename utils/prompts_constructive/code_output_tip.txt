Begin by giving a concise and clear description of your code, followed by the code itself. Your code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"
An example is given below:

-----

Some helpful tips:
(1) Do not modify the function signature.
(2) Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
(3) We only construct a solution once, so introducing stochasticity is not helpful.
(4) You DO NOT update the input variables. For example, you DO NOT remove the selected node from the unvisited nodes.
(5) You write novel algorithms instead of using classic and greedy ones. For example, DO NOT write Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
