Code description: The crossover algorithm will combine the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective scoring function. It will calculate the inverse distances of each edge as in Algorithm 2, and also compute the degree centrality of the destination node, similar to Algorithm 1. The heuristic measure for each edge will be obtained by multiplying the inverse distance with the degree centrality of the destination node. Finally, the heuristic measures will be normalized to ensure they sum up to 1.

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.
