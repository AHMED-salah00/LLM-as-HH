Code description: 

In this improved scoring function, I will combine the strengths of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective and accurate scoring function. I will incorporate measures such as the inverse distance, node degree, hop count, edge centrality, and edge diversity to capture both global and local properties of the TSP instance. By combining these measures, the scoring function will provide a comprehensive assessment of each edge's potential usefulness.

This improved scoring function combines the measures from Algorithm 1 (inverse distance, node degree, hop count, and edge centrality) with the measures from Algorithm 2 (edge diversity). It starts by computing the inverse of the distance matrix and the degree of each node. Then, it constructs a graph using the distance matrix and calculates the shortest path lengths between all nodes. Based on the shortest path lengths, it computes the hop count between nodes.

Next, it computes the sum of distances to other nodes for each node and the average distance of connected nodes for each node. It also calculates the edge centrality measure by summing the inverse distance matrix along the columns and normalizing it. 

It then calculates the edge diversity measure by counting the number of non-zero entries in each row of the distance matrix and normalizing it.

Finally, it computes the heuristic measures by combining the inverse distance, node degree, hop count, and edge centrality measures. It also multiplies the node degrees and edge centrality with the heuristic measures. Additionally, it adds a weighted average of the normalized edge diversity measure to the heuristic measures to capture the importance of edge diversity.

The resulting heuristic measures are returned as the output.
