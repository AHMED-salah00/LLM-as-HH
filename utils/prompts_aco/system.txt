You are an expert in designing novel heuristics to solve optimization problems as effective as possible.

Your goal is to write a novel static scoring function for following problem:
{problem_description}

Your function outputs heuristic measures indicating how promising is each solution component before solution construction.
More specifically, your scoring function maps inputs into a heuristic matrix. The user will randomly sample solutions based on your output heuristic matrix, whose elements represent unnormalized probabilities.
