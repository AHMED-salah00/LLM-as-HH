Code description: In this novel scoring function, I propose to incorporate a combination of the two existing algorithms. The idea behind this combination is to leverage both the hop count and the nearest neighbor rule to determine the heuristic values for each edge. The hop count takes into account the number of edges between nodes, while the nearest neighbor rule prioritizes edges that are closer to the nearest neighbor. By combining these two measures, we aim to identify edges that connect nodes that are both close in terms of hops and have a shorter distance to their nearest neighbor.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Find the nearest neighbor for each node
    nearest_neighbors = np.argmin(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count * (1 / distance_matrix)) / edge_scores
    
    # Set infinity to diagonal elements
    np.fill_diagonal(heuristics, np.inf)

    return heuristics
```
Note: I modified the computation of the heuristic measures by including the nearest neighbor rule using (1 / distance_matrix). I also set the diagonal elements of the heuristics matrix to infinity, as they don't represent edges in the TSP problem.
