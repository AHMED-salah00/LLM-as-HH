Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will incorporate the idea of both the clustering structure of the nodes and the closeness centrality into the heuristics calculation. I will make the following modifications to the given algorithm:
1. I will use spectral clustering instead of K-means clustering to capture the clustering structure of the nodes.
2. I will normalize the clustering factor using the maximum cluster distance.
3. I will normalize the closeness centrality by dividing it by the maximum centrality value.
4. I will eliminate the demand ratio constraint and instead use the demand factor as a penalty if the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity.
5. I will change the weights of the factors based on their relative importance.
