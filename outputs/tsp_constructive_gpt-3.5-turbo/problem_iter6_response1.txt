Code description: In this novel algorithm, we will select the next node based on a combination of distance and the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node. We will calculate a score for each unvisited node, where the score is determined by a weighted combination of these two factors. The node with the highest score will be selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node
    num_unvisited_neighbors = np.zeros(len(distance_matrix))
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        num_unvisited_neighbors[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        score = distance - 0.3 * num_unvisited_neighbors[node]
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
