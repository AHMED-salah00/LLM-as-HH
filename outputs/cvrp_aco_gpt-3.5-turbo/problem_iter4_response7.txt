Code description: 
In this modified scoring function, I will introduce a new factor - the closeness to the depot. I will calculate the distance between each node and the depot, and assign a higher heuristic measure to edges that are closer to the depot. Additionally, I will multiply the demand_ratio with the distance_ratio to give more importance to edges with higher demand and longer distance. By considering all these factors, the scoring function will provide a better estimate of the potential of each edge.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Set weight coefficients for distance, demand, position, and closeness to depot
    distance_weight = 0.3
    demand_weight = 0.3
    position_weight = 0.2
    depot_closeness_weight = 0.2
    
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            position = (j - 1) / (n_nodes - 1)
            depot_closeness = distance_matrix[i, 0] + distance_matrix[j, 0]
            
            # Normalize distance, demand, position, and depot closeness
            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio / max_demand
            normalized_position = position
            normalized_depot_closeness = depot_closeness / (2 * max_distance)
            
            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = -1e9
            else:
                distance_ratio = 1 - normalized_distance
                heuristics[i, j] = distance_weight * distance_ratio + demand_weight * normalized_demand_ratio + position_weight * normalized_position + depot_closeness_weight * normalized_depot_closeness
            
            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]
    
    return heuristics
```
Note: 
- The distance ratio is calculated as 1 - normalized_distance to give higher heuristic measures to shorter distances.
- The depot_closeness is calculated as the sum of the distances between the current node and the depot. It is then normalized by 2 * max_distance to ensure it is in the range [0, 1].

The weight coefficients for distance, demand, position, and depot closeness can be adjusted based on the problem characteristics and preferences.
