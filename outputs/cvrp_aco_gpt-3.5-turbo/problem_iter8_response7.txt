Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the clustering factor from Algorithm 1 and the degree centrality factor from Algorithm 2. I will also adjust the weights of the factors to optimize their contributions to the final heuristic measures. Additionally, I will precalculate some variables outside the loop for efficiency.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.5
    demand_weight = 0.2
    clustering_weight = 0.2
    degree_centrality_weight = 0.3
    
    # Calculate clustering factor
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])
    
    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i-1] == cluster_labels[j-1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = np.inf
                cluster_distances[j, i] = np.inf
    
    # Calculate the degree centrality of nodes
    adjacency_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix > 0, 1, 0)
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(adjacency_matrix)
    degree_centrality_values = list(nx.degree_centrality(G).values())
    
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])
    max_degree_centrality = np.max(degree_centrality_values)
    
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            cluster_distance = cluster_distances[i, j]
            degree_centrality = degree_centrality_values[j - 1]
            
            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio / max_demand
            normalized_cluster_distance = cluster_distance / max_distance
            normalized_degree_centrality = degree_centrality / max_degree_centrality
            
            heuristics[i, j] = (
                distance_weight * normalized_distance +
                demand_weight * normalized_demand_ratio +
                clustering_weight * (1 - normalized_cluster_distance) +
                degree_centrality_weight * normalized_degree_centrality
            )
            
            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]
    
    return heuristics
```

Note: In this improved scoring function, I combined the clustering factor from Algorithm 1 and the degree centrality factor from Algorithm 2. I adjusted the weights of the factors to optimize their contributions to the final heuristic measures. The heuristics are calculated using the normalized values of the factors, where the clustering factor is inverted (1 - normalized_cluster_distance) to align with the other positive-weighted factors.
