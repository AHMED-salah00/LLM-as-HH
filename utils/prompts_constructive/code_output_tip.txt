Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- We only construct a solution once, so introducing stochasticity is not helpful.
- You must focus on developing novel algorithms instead of relying on classic and greedy ones. For example, avoid using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
