Code description: 

My approach aims to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search space. I will select the next node based on a combination of the attractiveness of each unvisited node and the information about the nodes that have not been visited yet. 

I will first modify the distance matrix to include information about the number of unvisited nodes remaining in a particular path. This will introduce an additional factor into the attractiveness calculation. Then, I will calculate the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the modified distance matrix and the pheromone levels. Finally, I will select the next node probabilistically, taking into account both attractiveness and pheromone levels.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    alpha = 1.0
    beta = 1.0
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values

    # Calculate modified distance matrix
    unvisited_count_matrix = distance_matrix.copy()
    unvisited_count_matrix[:, list(unvisited_nodes)] += len(unvisited_nodes) - 1

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]**alpha * (1 / unvisited_count_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)])**beta

    # Calculate probability distribution for selecting the next node
    probability = attractiveness / np.sum(attractiveness)

    # Select next node based on probability distribution
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probability)

    return nxt_node
```
