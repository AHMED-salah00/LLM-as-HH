Code description: The crossover algorithm combines the best features of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective scoring function. It calculates the closeness centrality of each node using Algorithm 1 and incorporates the clustering structure of the nodes using Algorithm 2. Additionally, it adjusts the weights of the factors based on their importance. In this improved code, we use a more sophisticated way of calculating the normalized demand factor and modify the distance factor to better reflect edge quality.
