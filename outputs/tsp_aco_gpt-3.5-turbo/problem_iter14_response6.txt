Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the measures from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. I will use the shortest path lengths, degree centrality, edge density, clustering coefficient, edge importance, edge similarity, and connectivity information to create a more comprehensive and effective scoring function. By combining these measures, we can take into account the distance between nodes, their connectivity, and the graph structure to determine the heuristic measures for each edge.

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
