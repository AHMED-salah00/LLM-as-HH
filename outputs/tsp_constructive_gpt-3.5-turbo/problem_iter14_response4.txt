Code description: In this code, I propose a novel approach for selecting the next node to visit. The algorithm takes into account the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node. It also considers the average distance between each pair of unvisited nodes. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on these distances, and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. This approach aims to balance the distances from the current node, the destination node, and the unvisited nodes to make an effective decision.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance between each pair of unvisited nodes
    unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes
    avg_unvisited_distances = unvisited_distances.sum(axis=1) / (len(unvisited_nodes) - 1)
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    scores = 0.6 * current_distances - 0.3 * destination_distances - 0.1 * avg_unvisited_distances
    
    # Find the node with the highest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
Note that I have made a slight modification to Algorithm 2 by changing the weights of the distance factors. The modified weights aim to give more importance to the distance from the current node and slightly less importance to the distance from the destination node and the average distance between unvisited nodes. This adjustment is intended to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation, considering the current and future distances in the selection process.
