Code description: The novel scoring function aims to combine the strengths of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 while making slight modifications to better balance the contributions of each factor. The modified factors include adjusting the weights of distance, demand, and demand density, and introducing a new factor called "cross-clustering similarity" that measures the similarity in clustering between two edges.

Modifications to the novel scoring function:
1. Modify the weights of distance, demand, and demand density factors to achieve a better balance between them.
2. Adjust the weight of the clustering factor to be the same as Algorithm 1.
3. Introduce a new parameter "cross_clustering_weight" to control the weight of the cross-clustering similarity factor.
4. Calculate the cross-clustering similarity between edges i and j by counting the number of common clusters between the edges and dividing it by the maximum number of clusters that either edge belongs to.
5. Include the cross-clustering similarity factor in the calculation of the heuristic measure.
