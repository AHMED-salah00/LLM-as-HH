Code description: In this code, I will modify the algorithm to introduce a diversification strategy by selecting the next node based on a combination of attractiveness and distance. The goal is to balance exploration and exploitation by selecting nodes that are both attractive and have a reasonable distance from the current node.

To achieve this, I will calculate the attractiveness and distance values for each unvisited node. Then, I will introduce a parameter called "diversification_factor" that controls the importance of distance in the selection process.

Instead of simply selecting the node with the maximum combined score, I will use a weighted selection approach. The weighting will be determined by the attractiveness value, with higher attractiveness resulting in a higher probability of selection.

To implement this, I will calculate the cumulative sum of the attractiveness values and normalize it to obtain a probability distribution. Then, I will generate a random number between 0 and 1 and use binary search to find the index of the corresponding node in the distribution. The node at this index will be selected as the next node to visit.
