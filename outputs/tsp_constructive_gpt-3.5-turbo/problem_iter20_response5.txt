Code description: 
My code implements a novel selecting-next-node function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function selects the next node to visit based on a combination of distance score and a novel neighbor score. 

The distance score is calculated as the inverse of the distance between the current node and each unvisited node. A smaller distance corresponds to a higher score.

The neighbor score is calculated as the number of unvisited neighbors that each unvisited node has. A node with more unvisited neighbors has a higher score.

The trade-off parameter is used to adjust the relative importance of the distance score and neighbor score. By adjusting the trade-off parameter, the function can prioritize either minimizing distance or maximizing the number of unvisited neighbors.

The code selects the node with the highest combined score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    trade_off = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the distance scores for each unvisited node
    distance_scores = []
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        distance_score = 1 / (distance + 1e-6)  # Adding small epsilon to avoid division by zero
        distance_scores.append(distance_score)
    
    # Calculate the neighbor scores for each unvisited node
    neighbor_scores = []
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes) - 1
        neighbor_score = num_unvisited_neighbors
        neighbor_scores.append(neighbor_score)
    
    # Combine the distance scores and neighbor scores
    scores = trade_off * np.array(distance_scores) + (1 - trade_off) * np.array(neighbor_scores)
    
    # Select the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = np.argmax(scores)
    
    return nxt_node
```
