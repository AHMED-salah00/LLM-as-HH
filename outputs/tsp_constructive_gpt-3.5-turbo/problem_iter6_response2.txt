Code description: In this code, I will propose a new algorithm to select the next node based on the ratio of the distance to the destination node and the average edge weight. The goal is to select the next node that minimizes this ratio, as it represents the efficiency of the path.

I will start by initializing the next node variable (nxt_node) to None and the minimum ratio variable (min_ratio) to infinity. Then, I will iterate through all unvisited nodes to calculate the ratio for each node using the distance to the destination node and the average edge weight. If the calculated ratio is smaller than the minimum ratio found so far, I will update the minimum ratio and assign the unvisited node as the next node to visit.

Finally, I will return the next node as the output of the function.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    nxt_node = None
    min_ratio = float('inf')
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distances = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)]
        
        average_edge_weight = np.mean(distances)
        
        distance_to_dest = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        ratio = distance_to_dest / average_edge_weight

        if ratio < min_ratio:
            min_ratio = ratio
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
