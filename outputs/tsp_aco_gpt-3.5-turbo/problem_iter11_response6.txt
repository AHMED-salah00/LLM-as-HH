Code description: In this modified scoring function, I will introduce two additional measures: edge density and clustering coefficient. Edge density measures the average number of edges that each node has with other nodes. Clustering coefficient measures the extent to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together. By combining these measures with the shortest path lengths and degree centrality, we can create a more comprehensive scoring function.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.
