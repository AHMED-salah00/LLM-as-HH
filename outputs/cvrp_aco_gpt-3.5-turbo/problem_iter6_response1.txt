Code description: I will modify the original scoring function to include both a local search factor and a spatial proximity factor. The local search factor will assess the potential of an edge by considering the distances between neighboring nodes, while the spatial proximity factor will evaluate the suitability of an edge based on the spatial proximity of its nodes. Additionally, I will modify the weight distribution to give more importance to the local search factor.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.6  # Weight for the local search factor
    proximity_weight = 0.4  # Weight for the spatial proximity factor

    # Calculate degree centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)

    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY

            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio

            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = -1e9
            else:
                local_search_factor = (1 - normalized_distance) / (degree_centrality[i] + degree_centrality[j])
                proximity_factor = (1 - normalized_demand_ratio) / (degree_centrality[i] + degree_centrality[j])

                heuristics[i, j] = (
                    distance_weight * local_search_factor +
                    proximity_weight * proximity_factor
                )

            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```
