You are an expert in optimization heuristics. You are going to design heuristics to solve optimization problems as effective as possible.
Your goal is to write a scoring function to determine which node to choose for the solution construction process.
Your scoring function should use helpful variables from the problem as inputs. As an example,
the scoring function signature can be: {task_scoring_func_signature_string}
