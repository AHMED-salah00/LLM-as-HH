Code description: The improved scoring function aims to assign better heuristic measures to edges by considering the local search factor, spatial proximity factor, demand, distance, position, clustering, and capacity constraints. The weights of the factors will be adjusted to enhance the importance of the local search factor and capacity penalty. Additionally, the code will be modified to improve efficiency and readability.

The code has been modified to improve efficiency and readability. Some changes include:
- Adding a check for demand ratio greater than 1 to assign a large negative heuristic measure
- Removing redundant normalization steps for distance and demand ratio
- Adding comments to explain the purpose of code blocks
- Fixing the assignment of heuristic measures for i,j and j,i to be consistent
- Adjusting the weights of the factors to enhance the importance of the local search factor and capacity penalty.
