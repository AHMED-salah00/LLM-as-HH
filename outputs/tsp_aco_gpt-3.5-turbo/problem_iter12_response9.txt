Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the measures from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more comprehensive scoring function. The scoring function will incorporate the shortest path lengths, degree centrality, edge density, clustering coefficient, edge importance, and edge similarity measures. By combining these measures, we can create a more accurate and effective scoring function for the TSP instance.

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
