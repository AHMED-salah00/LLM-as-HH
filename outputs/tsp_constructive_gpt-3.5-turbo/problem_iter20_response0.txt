Code description: 
In this code, I will propose a novel algorithm called "Progressive Selection Algorithm" to select the next node. The algorithm considers both the distance between the current node and the unvisited nodes, as well as the distance between the unvisited nodes and the destination node. It aims to select the node that has the highest progress towards reaching the destination, while also considering the distance from the current node. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node by combining these two factors, and selects the node with the highest score. 

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    selected_node = None
    
    # Calculate the maximum distance from the current node to any unvisited node
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)])
    
    # Iterate over all unvisited nodes
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Calculate the distance from the current node to the unvisited node
        current_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the distance from the unvisited node to the destination node
        destination_distance = distance_matrix[node, destination_node]
        
        # Calculate the score for the unvisited node
        score = (max_distance - current_distance) + destination_distance
        
        # Update the selected node if the score is higher than the current maximum
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            selected_node = node
    
    # Return the selected node
    return selected_node
```
