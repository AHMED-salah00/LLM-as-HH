Task: Solving a black-box graph combinatorial optimization problem via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics". You should create a totally new `heuristics` function for me (different from the heuristics in the literature). The `heuristics` function takes as input a matrix of edge attributes and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input matrix.
