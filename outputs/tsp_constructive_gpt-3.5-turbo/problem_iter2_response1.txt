Code description: The code selects the next node to visit based on the following criteria:
1. It calculates the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes.
2. It calculates the distances from the destination node to all unvisited nodes.
3. It calculates the distances from the current node to the destination node.
4. It calculates the weighted distances by combining the distances from the current node to the unvisited nodes and the distances from the destination node to the unvisited nodes.
5. It selects the unvisited node with the maximum weighted distance as the next node to visit.

```python

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using a novel algorithm.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
