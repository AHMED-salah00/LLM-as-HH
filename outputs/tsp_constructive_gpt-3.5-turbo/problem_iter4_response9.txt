Code description: The code implements a novel heuristic called Weighted Distance and Degree with Neighborhood Exploration. This heuristic selects the next node to visit based on the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, weighted by the degree of each unvisited node. In addition, it explores the neighborhood of the current node and considers the distance and degree of the neighboring nodes. The node with the highest weighted distance, considering both the current node and its neighbors, is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using the Weighted Distance and Degree with Neighborhood Exploration heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
