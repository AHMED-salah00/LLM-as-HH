Code description: In this code, I propose a novel algorithm for selecting the next node to visit. This algorithm considers two factors: the distance to the current node and the number of unvisited nodes that can be reached from each unvisited node. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on these factors and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. The rationale behind this approach is to prioritize nodes that are both close to the current node and have a high connectivity to unvisited nodes.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distances from current node to all unvisited nodes
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the number of unvisited nodes that can be reached from each unvisited node
    reachable_nodes = [len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[i,:] < np.inf))) for i in unvisited_nodes]
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node based on distance and reachability
    scores = current_distances / (reachable_nodes + 1)
    
    # Select node with highest score as the next node to visit
    nxt_node = unvisited_nodes[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
