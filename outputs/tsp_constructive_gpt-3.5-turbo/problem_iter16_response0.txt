Code description: In this novel algorithm, I propose a modification to the original algorithm that takes into account not only the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, but also the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node. Additionally, I introduce a new factor called "Neighbor Priority" which considers the importance of the neighboring unvisited nodes. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node by combining these factors and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Neighbor Priority for each unvisited node
    neighbor_priority = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_priority[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))]) / len(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.5 * current_distances - 0.25 * destination_distances + 0.25 * np.array(list(neighbor_priority.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

I have removed the calculation of the modified Greedy Squeezing distance and the Node Priority from Algorithm 2, as I found that the Neighbor Priority factor provides similar information. The combined scores are calculated using a weighted sum of the current distances, destination distances, and neighbor priorities, with higher weight given to the current distances and neighbor priorities. The node with the highest combined score is selected as the next node to visit.
