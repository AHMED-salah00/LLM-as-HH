    Map distance_matrix into heuristic measures, which indicates how promising it is to include each edge in a solution.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    -------
    heuristics : np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.
