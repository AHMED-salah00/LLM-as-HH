Code description: The crossover algorithm combines elements from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a novel scoring function. It incorporates the inverse distance matrix, degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and closeness centrality of the nodes to calculate the heuristic measures for each edge. The goal is to prioritize edges that are both short in distance, connected to nodes with higher centrality, have a high clustering coefficient, and have nodes that are close to other nodes.

Here is the modified scoring function:

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
from scipy.sparse import csgraph

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the number of connections for each node
    node_degrees = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude self-loop
    
    # Create a graph from the distance matrix
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    
    # Compute the clustering coefficient of each node
    clustering_coefficient = np.array([nx.clustering(graph, node) for node in range(n_nodes)])
    
    # Compute the closeness centrality of each node
    closeness_centrality = csgraph.shortest_path(distance_matrix, directed=False)
    closeness_centrality = 1 / np.average(closeness_centrality, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    max_node_score = np.max(node_degrees)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            distance_score = 1 / (distance_matrix[i,j] + 1)
            edge_importance[i, j] = (node_degrees[i] + node_degrees[j]) / (2 * max_node_score) * distance_score
    
    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = inverse_distance_matrix * degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis] * clustering_coefficient[:, np.newaxis] * closeness_centrality[np.newaxis, :]
    
    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```

This modified scoring function combines the edge importance measure from Algorithm 1 with the inverse distance matrix, degree centrality, clustering coefficient, and closeness centrality from Algorithm 2. It aims to produce heuristic measures that prioritize edges that are shorter in distance, connected to nodes with higher centrality, have a high clustering coefficient, and have nodes that are close to other nodes.
