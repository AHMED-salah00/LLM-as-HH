Code description: 

This modified scoring function combines ideas from the previous algorithms and introduces a new approach. Instead of calculating just the sum of distances to other nodes as in Algorithm 1, we will use the concept of average minimum spanning tree (AMST) to estimate the importance of each node. The AMST is a subgraph of the original graph that spans all nodes and has the minimum sum of edge weights. By calculating the AMST and considering the weight of connecting edges, we can estimate the importance of each node and use this information to assign heuristic measures to the edges.

The code first calculates the AMST by applying Prim's algorithm. It then computes the weight of each node as the sum of the weights of edges connected to it. Finally, it assigns a heuristic measure to each edge based on the weight of connecting nodes and normalizes the measures so that they sum up to 1.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import minimum_spanning_tree

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Calculate the average minimum spanning tree
    graph = csr_matrix(distance_matrix)
    amst = minimum_spanning_tree(graph).toarray()
    
    # Calculate the weights of each node based on the AMST
    node_weights = np.sum(amst, axis=1)
    
    # Initialize the heuristic measures matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    # Calculate the heuristic measure for each edge
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics[i, j] = (node_weights[i] + node_weights[j]) / (2 * np.sum(node_weights))

    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```
