Code description: 

I propose a novel algorithm called "Combined Attractiveness and Closeness Centrality Algorithm" to select the next node. This algorithm combines the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It calculates the attractiveness for each unvisited node based on the distance to the destination node and the distance to the current node. It also considers the closeness centrality of each unvisited node. The selected node will have a high attractiveness and closeness centrality, indicating that it is both close to the current node and has a high centrality in the network.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of nodes
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the attractiveness for each unvisited node
    attractiveness = distance_matrix[:, destination_node] - distance_matrix[:, current_node]
    
    # Calculate the closeness centrality of each unvisited node
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(nx.Graph(distance_matrix))
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[node] > 0)))
        
        # Calculate the combined score based on attractiveness, closeness centrality, and number of unvisited neighbors
        score = attractiveness[node] + closeness_centrality[node] + num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: This algorithm integrates the attractiveness calculation from Algorithm 2 and the savings calculation from Algorithm 1. It also incorporates the closeness centrality and the number of unvisited neighbors. By combining these factors, the algorithm is likely to select a node that is both close to the current node and has a high centrality in the network.
