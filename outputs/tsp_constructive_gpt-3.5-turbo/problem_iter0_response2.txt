Code description: My code uses a novel algorithm called "Nearest Insertion" to select the next node in the TSP problem. 

Nearest Insertion works as follows:
1. Initialize the solution with two arbitrary nodes.
2. While there are unvisited nodes:
     a. Select the unvisited node that is closest to any node in the current solution.
     b. Find the two edges in the current solution where inserting the selected node would create the shortest additional distance.
     c. Insert the selected node between the two edges.
3. Return the next node that was inserted.

The code first initializes the solution by randomly selecting two nodes. Then, it iterates until all nodes are visited, selecting the unvisited node that minimizes the additional distance when inserted into the current solution. Finally, it returns the next node that was inserted.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Randomly select two starting nodes
    start_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes))
    unvisited_nodes.remove(start_node)
    current_solution = [start_node]
    nxt_node = start_node
    
    while unvisited_nodes:
        # Find the node closest to any node in the current solution
        min_dist = np.inf
        for node in unvisited_nodes:
            for i, c_node in enumerate(current_solution):
                dist = distance_matrix[node, c_node]
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    nxt_node = node
                    prev_node = current_solution[i-1]
                    next_node = current_solution[i]
                    
        # Find the two edges where inserting the selected node would create the shortest additional distance
        min_add_dist = np.inf
        for i, c_node in enumerate(current_solution):
            dist1 = distance_matrix[nxt_node, c_node]
            dist2 = distance_matrix[nxt_node, current_solution[i-1]]
            add_dist = dist1 + dist2 - distance_matrix[current_solution[i-1], c_node]
            if add_dist < min_add_dist:
                min_add_dist = add_dist
                prev_node = current_solution[i-1]
                next_node = current_solution[i]
        
        # Insert the selected node between the two edges
        current_solution.insert(current_solution.index(next_node), nxt_node)
        
        unvisited_nodes.remove(nxt_node)
    
    return nxt_node
```
