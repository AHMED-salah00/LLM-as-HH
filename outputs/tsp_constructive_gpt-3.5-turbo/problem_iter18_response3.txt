Code description: 

The crossover algorithm combines the concepts from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a novel node selection strategy. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on a combination of distance to the current node, closeness centrality, and the number of unvisited neighboring nodes. The score is a weighted combination of these factors, and the node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    weight1 = 0.4
    weight2 = 0.3
    weight3 = 0.3
    
    # Calculate the closeness centrality of each unvisited node
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(nx.Graph(distance_matrix))
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[node] > 0)))
        
        score = weight1 * (1 / distance_to_current) + weight2 * closeness_centrality[node] - weight3 * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
