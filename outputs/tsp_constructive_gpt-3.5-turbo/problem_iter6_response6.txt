Code description: The following code implements a selecting-next-node function called "Minimum Distance Plus Random". 

This algorithm selects the next node based on a combination of the distance to the current node and a random exploration factor.

The algorithm starts by calculating the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes. It then assigns a score to each unvisited node based on its distance. The score is calculated as the sum of the distance and a random number between 0 and a parameter called "exploration_factor". This parameter controls the level of randomness in the selection process, with higher values resulting in more random exploration.

The function then selects the next node with the minimum score. If there are multiple nodes with the same minimum score, one of them is randomly chosen.

The function returns the index of the selected node.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray, exploration_factor: float) -> int:
    # Calculate distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Calculate the scores for all unvisited nodes based on the distance and random exploration
    scores = unvisited_distances + exploration_factor * np.random.random(len(unvisited_distances))

    # Find the minimum score
    min_score = np.min(scores)

    # Find all nodes with the minimum score
    min_score_nodes = [node for node, score in zip(list(unvisited_nodes), scores) if score == min_score]

    # Select a random node with the minimum score
    next_node = random.choice(min_score_nodes)

    return next_node
```
