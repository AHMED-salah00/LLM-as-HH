Code description: The crossover of the two algorithms aims to combine the benefits of considering distance, number of connections, inverse distances, and edge centrality. The improved scoring function will calculate the heuristic measure for each edge as the product of the inverse distance, the inverse number of connections of the destination node, and the centrality score of the edge. The heuristic measures will be normalized so that they sum up to 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray

    heuristics: np.ndarray

This improved scoring function combines distance, number of connections, inverse distances, and edge centrality to calculate the heuristic measure for each edge. It takes into account the inverse distance between nodes, the inverse number of connections of the destination node, and the centrality score of the edge. Normalization is applied to the heuristic measures to ensure they sum up to 1.
