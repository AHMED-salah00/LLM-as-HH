Code description: 

This code uses a novel selecting-next-node function for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm selects the next node to visit based on a modified version of the nearest neighbor heuristic. Instead of always selecting the nearest unvisited node, the algorithm randomly selects one of the nearest unvisited nodes. This introduces some randomness into the construction process, potentially giving better solutions. The algorithm calculates the distance between the current node and all unvisited nodes, selects the nearest nodes, and then randomly selects one of them as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    # Calculate distances between current node and all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Find the nearest nodes
    nearest_nodes = np.where(distances == np.min(distances))[0]
    
    # Select one of the nearest nodes randomly
    nxt_node = random.choice(nearest_nodes)
    
    return nxt_node
```
