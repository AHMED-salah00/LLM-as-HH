Code description: 

The novel algorithm I propose is called Hybrid Distance Selection (HDS). It combines the concept of the Modified Greedy Squeezing (MGS) distance from Algorithm 2 with a novel approach to selecting the next node based on the distance matrix. 

Instead of calculating the MGS distance for each unvisited node, we will calculate the average MGS distance for the unvisited nodes. This average distance will be used to prioritize the selection of the next node. 

Next, we will sort the unvisited nodes based on their distances from the current node. The nodes that are closer to the current node will have higher priority for selection. 

Finally, we select the next node based on the combination of the average MGS distance and the sorted distances. The node that has the highest combination of these two factors will be selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).

    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
