Write a scoring function for {problem_description}. 
Your function outputs heuristic measures indicating how promising is each edge before actually solving a problem instance.
More specifically, your scoring function maps inputs into a heuristic matrix. We will randomly sample solutions based on your output heuristic matrix, where the matrix elements represent unnormalized probabilities.
The function signature is as follows:
