Code description: In this modified scoring function, I will incorporate the idea of closeness centrality into the heuristics calculation. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the graph. By incorporating closeness centrality as a factor, we can consider the accessibility and connectedness of each node when calculating the heuristic measures.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.25  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.15  # Weight for the demand factor
    position_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the position factor
    depot_closeness_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the depot closeness factor
    closeness_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the closeness centrality factor

    # Calculate degree centrality and closeness centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(G)

    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            position = (j - 1) / (n_nodes - 1)
            depot_closeness = distance_matrix[i, 0] + distance_matrix[j, 0]
            closeness = closeness_centrality[j]

            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio / max_demand
            normalized_position = position
            normalized_depot_closeness = depot_closeness / (2 * max_distance)
            normalized_closeness = closeness

            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = -1e9
            else:
                distance_ratio = 1 - normalized_distance
                heuristics[i, j] = (
                    distance_weight * distance_ratio
                    + demand_weight * normalized_demand_ratio
                    + position_weight * normalized_position
                    + depot_closeness_weight * normalized_depot_closeness
                    + closeness_weight * normalized_closeness
                )

            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```
