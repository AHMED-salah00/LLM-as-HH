Code Description: 

The crossover algorithm takes inspiration from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a new selecting-next-node function. This new algorithm considers the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, the distance from the destination node to each unvisited node, and the degree centrality of the unvisited nodes to make a better decision for selecting the next node. The algorithm aims to balance the trade-off between current distance, destination distance, and connectivity to improve the quality of the solution construction process.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
    weights = np.array([1 + sum(1 for neighbor in unvisited_nodes if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]) for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node] / (distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)] * weights)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.6 * current_distances - 0.4 * destination_distances + 0.2 * mgs_distance + 0.2 * np.array([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
