Code description: 

This code implements a modified version of the ClosestCluster function to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The original code groups the unvisited nodes into clusters based on their proximity to each other and selects the cluster with the closest centroid. It then selects the unvisited node within the selected cluster that is closest to the current node as the next node to visit. 

I will modify the code to introduce a new selection strategy called "FurthestCluster". Instead of selecting the cluster with the closest centroid, this strategy selects the cluster with the furthest centroid from the current node. This can help in exploration by encouraging the algorithm to visit clusters that are farther away. Within the selected cluster, we will still select the node closest to the current node as before.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on the furthest cluster.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
