Code description: 
In this code, I propose a novel algorithm for selecting the next node in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm is based on a combination of nearest neighbor and 2-opt techniques. 

The algorithm starts by selecting the nearest unvisited node to the current node. This is done by calculating the distance between the current node and all unvisited nodes and selecting the node with the minimum distance. 

After selecting the nearest node, the algorithm applies a 2-opt technique to improve the current solution. The 2-opt technique involves removing two edges from the current solution and reconnecting them in a different way, resulting in a shorter path. This is repeated until no more improvements can be made.

Finally, the algorithm returns the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Find the nearest unvisited node
    nearest_node = min(unvisited_nodes, key=lambda node: distance_matrix[current_node][node])
    
    # Apply 2-opt technique
    improved = True
    while improved:
        improved = False
        for i in range(len(unvisited_nodes)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(unvisited_nodes)):
                node1 = unvisited_nodes[i]
                node2 = unvisited_nodes[j]
                new_distance = (distance_matrix[current_node][node1] + distance_matrix[destination_node][node2]) - (distance_matrix[current_node][node2] + distance_matrix[destination_node][node1])
                if new_distance < 0:
                    nearest_node = node1
                    improved = True
                    break
            if improved:
                break
    
    return nearest_node
```
