def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Map the inputs into heuristic measures, which indicates how promising it is to include each edge in a solution.
    Note that the depot is indexed as 0, and fixed in the middle of all nodes. The demand of the depot is set to 0, i.e., demands[0] = 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to a very large number.
    demands : np.ndarray
        The customer demands of nodes, where demands[0] = 0.
    capacity : int
        The capacity of a vehicle.
    
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics : np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.
