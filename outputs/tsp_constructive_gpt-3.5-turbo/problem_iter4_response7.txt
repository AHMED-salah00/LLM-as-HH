Code description: The novel code selects the next node to visit based on a combination of uncertainty and distance. Instead of solely considering the uncertainty in the distances, it takes into account both the uncertainty score and the distance from the current node to each unvisited node. The next node is selected by lowering the uncertainty score and minimizing the distance at the same time.

The updated code considers a weighted sum of the uncertainty scores and the distances, and selects the next node based on the minimum weighted sum. This allows for more flexibility in selecting the next node, as it takes into account the importance of both factors.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on a combination of uncertainty and distance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.

    distances = distance_matrix[current_node]
    uncertainty_scores = []
    nxt_node = -1

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distances[node]
        variability = np.std(distance_matrix[:, node])
        uncertainty_scores.append(variability)

    weighted_sum = [score + (distance / np.mean(distances)) for score, distance in zip(uncertainty_scores, distances)]
    min_weighted_sum = np.min(weighted_sum)
    possible_next_nodes = [node for node, score in zip(unvisited_nodes, weighted_sum) if score == min_weighted_sum]
    nxt_node = possible_next_nodes[0]  # Select the first node with the minimum weighted sum

    return nxt_node
