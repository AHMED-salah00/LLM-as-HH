Code description: The current algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree from the current node to all unvisited nodes and selects the unvisited node with the shortest distance to the minimum spanning tree. In order to improve the algorithm, we can introduce a randomized element to the selection process. This can help to explore different paths and potentially find better solutions. 

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import minimum_spanning_tree

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    node_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Construct a minimum spanning tree
    subgraph_nodes = [current_node] + list(unvisited_nodes)
    subgraph_distances = distance_matrix[np.ix_(subgraph_nodes, subgraph_nodes)]
    subgraph = minimum_spanning_tree(csr_matrix(subgraph_distances))
    
    # Calculate the distance from the minimum spanning tree to each unvisited node
    mst_distances = subgraph.toarray()
    mst_node_distances = mst_distances[0, 1:]
    
    # Randomly select one of the unvisited nodes with the shortest distance to the minimum spanning tree
    min_distance = np.min(mst_node_distances)
    indices = np.where(mst_node_distances == min_distance)[0]
    rand_index = np.random.choice(indices)
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[rand_index]
    
    return nxt_node
```
