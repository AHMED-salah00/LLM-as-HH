Code description: 
The improved scoring function takes into account the distance between nodes, the degree centrality of nodes, and the edge importance measure to compute the heuristic measures. 

To improve the scoring function, I will modify the calculation of the edge importance measure by considering the distance between nodes. Additionally, I will incorporate another measure that captures the potential connectivity between nodes in the TSP instance. 

The modified scoring function will include the following steps:
1. Compute the inverse of the distance matrix.
2. Compute the degree centrality of each node.
3. Compute the number of connections for each node.
4. Create a graph from the distance matrix.
5. Compute the clustering coefficient of each node.
6. Compute the edge importance measure based on the degree centrality and the distance between nodes.
7. Compute the connectivity information based on the degrees of nodes and the number of common neighbors.
8. Calculate the heuristic measures by combining the inverse distance matrix, degree centrality, edge importance, and connectivity information.
9. Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1.
