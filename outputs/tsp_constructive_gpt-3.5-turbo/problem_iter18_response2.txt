Code description: In this code, I propose a novel algorithm that selects the next node based on a combination of two criteria: proximity to the current node and density of unvisited nodes in its neighborhood. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on these criteria and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Calculate proximity score for each unvisited node
    proximity_score = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        proximity_score[node] = 1 / distance_matrix[current_node][node]
    
    # Calculate density score for each unvisited node
    density_score = {}
    radius = np.mean(distance_matrix) / 2  # Set the radius as half of the mean distance
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        node_coords = np.array([[distance_matrix[current_node][node]]])
        unvisited_coords = np.array([[distance_matrix[current_node][unvisited_node]] for unvisited_node in unvisited_nodes])
        
        dists = cdist(node_coords, unvisited_coords)
        num_nodes = np.sum(dists < radius)
        
        density_score[node] = num_nodes / len(unvisited_nodes)
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        scores[node] = proximity_score[node] * density_score[node]
    
    nxt_node = max(scores, key=scores.get)

    return nxt_node
```

This algorithm uses two criteria for node selection: proximity score and density score. The proximity score is calculated as the inverse of the distance from the current node to each unvisited node. The density score is calculated as the ratio of the number of unvisited nodes within a certain radius of each node to the total number of unvisited nodes. The algorithm combines these scores for each node and selects the node with the highest combined score as the next node to visit.
