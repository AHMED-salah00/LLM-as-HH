Code description: 
In this improved scoring function, I will extend the concept used in Algorithm 2 to assign heuristic measures to each edge. Instead of only considering the node degrees, I will compute a weighted sum of node degrees and shortest path lengths between the nodes connected by an edge. This will allow the scoring function to prioritize edges that connect nodes with high degrees and short distances, indicating that they are more likely to be part of an optimal solution.

```python
import numpy as np


def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.

    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the shortest path lengths between all nodes using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    shortest_paths = np.copy(distance_matrix)
    for k in range(n_nodes):
        for i in range(n_nodes):
            for j in range(n_nodes):
                shortest_paths[i, j] = min(shortest_paths[i, j], shortest_paths[i, k] + shortest_paths[k, j])

    # Compute the node degrees
    node_degrees = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1)

    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            if i != j:
                # Compute a weighted sum of node degrees and shortest path lengths
                heuristic_measure = (node_degrees[i] + shortest_paths[i, j]) / (2 * n_nodes * np.max(distance_matrix))
                heuristics[i, j] = heuristic_measure

```

The scoring function first computes the shortest path lengths between all nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, similar to Algorithm 1. Then, it computes the node degrees, similar to Algorithm 2. Finally, it combines the node degrees and shortest path lengths to compute the heuristic measures for each edge. The edge heuristic measure is calculated as the weighted sum of the node degrees and shortest path lengths between the nodes connected by the edge. The weights are scaled to ensure that the heuristic measures are normalized to sum up to 1. The resulting heuristic measures indicate how promising each edge is before actually solving the TSP instance.
