Code description: 

In this code, I propose a novel algorithm that selects the next node based on a combination of three criteria: proximity to the current node, distance to the destination node, and the balance between these two distances. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on these criteria and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Calculate proximity score for each unvisited node
    proximity_score = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        proximity_score[node] = 1 / distance_matrix[current_node][node]
    
    # Calculate destination distance score for each unvisited node
    destination_score = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        destination_score[node] = 1 / distance_matrix[destination_node][node]
    
    # Calculate balanced score for each unvisited node
    balanced_score = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        balanced_score[node] = proximity_score[node] / (proximity_score[node] + destination_score[node])
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    scores = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        scores[node] = balanced_score[node]
    
    nxt_node = max(scores, key=scores.get)

    return nxt_node
```
