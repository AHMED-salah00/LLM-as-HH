Code description: In this modified scoring function, I will introduce a new factor based on the proximity to the depot node. This factor will assign higher scores to edges that are closer to the depot. I will adjust the weights of the different factors to better balance their contributions to the final heuristic measures. Additionally, I will restructure the code to improve efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.4
    demand_weight = 0.3
    clustering_weight = 0.2
    position_weight = 0.1
    depot_proximity_weight = 0.8

    # Calculate clustering factor
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])

    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i - 1] == cluster_labels[j - 1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = np.max(distance_matrix)
                cluster_distances[j, i] = np.max(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate node distances from the depot
    depot_distances = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        depot_distances[i] = distance_matrix[0, i]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate heuristic measures
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            cluster_distance = cluster_distances[i, j]
            position = j / (n_nodes - 1)
            depot_distance = depot_distances[j]

            inverted_distance = 1 / distance
            clustering_factor = np.exp(-cluster_distance / max_distance)
            position_factor = 1 - position
            depot_proximity_factor = 1 - (depot_distance / max_distance)

            heuristics[i, j] = (
                distance_weight * inverted_distance
                + demand_weight * demand_ratio
                + clustering_weight * clustering_factor
                + position_weight * position_factor
                + depot_proximity_weight * depot_proximity_factor
            )

            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```

In this modified scoring function, I made the following changes:

1. Adjusted the weights of the different factors to better balance their contributions to the final heuristic measures.
2. Introduced a new factor based on the proximity to the depot.
3. Restructured the code to improve efficiency by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
4. Increased the number of clusters in the KMeans algorithm from 4 to 5 for better clustering.
5. Used the max distance in the distance matrix as the reference distance for clustering factor calculation and depot proximity factor calculation.
6. Calculated the distances of each node from the depot beforehand to avoid repetitive calculations inside the loop.
7. Reassigned the weights to better balance the contributions of all factors.

These modifications aim to improve the effectiveness of the scoring function by considering both demand and proximity to the depot, and by adjusting the weights of the factors to better reflect their importance in the optimization problem.
