Code description: In this improved scoring function, I propose a novel approach that combines the concepts from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The scoring function considers the hop count, node degree, and edge centrality measures to capture both local and global properties of the TSP instance. By combining these measures, we aim to develop a more effective scoring function that can better assess the potential usefulness of each edge in the TSP instance.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count * edge_scores) / (edge_scores**2)
    
    # Calculate node degree
    node_degree = np.sum(distance_matrix <= (n_nodes-1), axis=1)
    
    # Multiply the node degree with the heuristic measures
    heuristics *= node_degree[:, np.newaxis]
    
    # Compute the edge centrality measure
    edge_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)
    
    # Multiply the edge centrality with the heuristic measures
    heuristics *= edge_centrality[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
```
