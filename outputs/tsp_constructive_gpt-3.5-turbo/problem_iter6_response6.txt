Code description: In this code, I will propose a new selecting-next-node function that combines the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The goal is to select the next node that minimizes the distance to both the current node and the destination node, while also considering the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on a dynamically adjusted alpha value.

I will start by calculating the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes, the distances from the destination node to all unvisited nodes, and the distance from the current node to the destination node, similar to Algorithm 1.

Next, I will calculate the weighted distances, which is the sum of the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes and the distances from the destination node to those unvisited nodes, just like in Algorithm 1.

Then, I will determine the adaptive alpha value based on the number of remaining unvisited nodes. If the number of remaining nodes is small, I will increase the alpha value to favor exploration and avoid getting stuck in local optima. If the number of remaining nodes is large, I will decrease the alpha value to favor exploitation and focus on exploiting promising regions of the search space.

After that, I will calculate the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the dynamically adjusted alpha value and the pheromone levels. This will give a score that balances both the distance and the attractiveness.

Finally, I will select the unvisited node with the maximum combined score as the next node to visit and return it as the output of the function.
