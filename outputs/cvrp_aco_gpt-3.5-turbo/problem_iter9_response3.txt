Code description: In this modified scoring function, I will incorporate the factors from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective scoring function. I will consider the distance, demand, position, degree centrality, demand density, and depot distance factors. The weights of each factor will be adjusted to optimize their contributions to the final heuristic measures. Additionally, I will initialize the heuristics matrix outside the loop for efficiency purposes.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from scipy.spatial import distance

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.2
    demand_weight = 0.2
    centrality_weight = 0.15
    spatial_weight = 0.1
    demand_density_weight = 0.15
    depot_distance_weight = 0.2
    
    # Calculate degree centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
    
    # Calculate clustering factors
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])
    
    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i-1] == cluster_labels[j-1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = np.max(distance_matrix)
                cluster_distances[j, i] = np.max(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate demand density
    demand_density = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        neighbor_demand_sum = demands[i]
        neighbor_count = 1
        
        for j in range(1, n_nodes):
            if j != i and distance_matrix[i, j] < np.max(distance_matrix):
                neighbor_demand_sum += demands[j]
                neighbor_count += 1
        
        demand_density[i] = neighbor_demand_sum / (np.max(distance_matrix) * neighbor_count)
    
    # Calculate distance to depot
    depot_distance = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        depot_distance[i] = distance.euclidean(distance_matrix[i, :], distance_matrix[0, :])
    
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_sum = demands[i] + demands[j]
            
            normalized_distance = distance / np.max(distance_matrix)
            normalized_demand_sum = demand_sum / np.max(demands)
            normalized_centrality = centrality[j]
            normalized_spatial = cluster_distances[i, j] / np.max(distance_matrix)
            normalized_demand_density = demand_density[j] / np.max(demand_density)
            normalized_depot_distance = depot_distance[j] / np.max(depot_distance)
            
            heuristics[i, j] = (
                distance_weight * normalized_distance +
                demand_weight * normalized_demand_sum +
                centrality_weight * normalized_centrality +
                spatial_weight * normalized_spatial +
                demand_density_weight * normalized_demand_density +
                depot_distance_weight * normalized_depot_distance
            )
            
            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]
    
    return heuristics
```

In this modified code, I have made the following changes:
1. Changed `centrality_weight` from 0.1 to 0.15 to give more importance to degree centrality.
2. Removed the normalization step for `normalized_demand_sum` and `normalized_demand_density` as it was unnecessary since the division is already done with the maximum demand and demand density values.
3. Modified the comments for better code readability.

These modifications are made in order to enhance the heuristic measures and optimize the contributions of each factor in the final scoring function.
