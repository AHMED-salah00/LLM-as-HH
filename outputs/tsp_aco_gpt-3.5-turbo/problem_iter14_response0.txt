Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The function will calculate the inverse distances as in Algorithm 1, but instead of using the modification factor based on the number of connections, it will utilize the edge density and clustering coefficient from Algorithm 2 to adjust the heuristic measures for each edge. By incorporating these additional measures, the scoring function will be more comprehensive and better able to capture the characteristics of the TSP instance.

import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.

    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
