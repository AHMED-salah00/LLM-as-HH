Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will modify the algorithm to include two new factors in the heuristic measure: the straight-line distance between nodes and the demand difference between nodes. These factors will be weighted and combined with the existing factors to form a more comprehensive measure.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.4  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.3  # Weight for the demand factor
    capacity_penalty_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the capacity penalty factor
    straight_line_distance_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the straight-line distance factor
    demand_difference_weight = 0.1  # Weight for the demand difference factor

    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(i+1, n_nodes):
            demand_sum = demands[i] + demands[j]
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            
            straight_line_distance = np.linalg.norm(distance_matrix[i]-distance_matrix[j])
            demand_difference = np.abs(demands[i] - demands[j])

            inverted_distance = 1 / distance
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY

            if demand_ratio > 1:
                capacity_penalty = capacity_penalty_weight * (demand_sum - CAPACITY)
                heuristic_measure = 0
            else:
                capacity_penalty = 0
                heuristic_measure = inverted_distance ** distance_weight * demand_ratio ** demand_weight
                heuristic_measure *= straight_line_distance ** straight_line_distance_weight
                heuristic_measure *= demand_difference ** demand_difference_weight

            heuristic_measure *= (1 - capacity_penalty)

            heuristics[i, j] = heuristic_measure
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristic_measure
    
    return heuristics
```
In this modified code, I have added two new factors to the heuristic measure: the straight-line distance and the demand difference between nodes. These factors are weighted and combined with the existing factors to form a more comprehensive measure. The weights for the new factors are set to 0.1 each, while the weights for the existing factors are adjusted accordingly. The distance_matrix and demands arrays are used to calculate the distance, straight-line distance, demand ratio, and demand difference between nodes. The capacity_penalty factor penalizes edges that exceed the vehicle capacity. The final heuristic measure is calculated by multiplying the individual factors and the capacity_penalty factor. The resulting heuristics matrix is returned as the output.
