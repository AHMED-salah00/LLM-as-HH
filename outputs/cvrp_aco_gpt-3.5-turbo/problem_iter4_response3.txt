Code description: The goal of this modified scoring function is to incorporate an additional factor that takes into account the degree centrality of each node in the graph. Degree centrality is a measure of how well connected a node is to other nodes in the graph. Nodes with higher degree centrality are generally more important in terms of connectivity and can potentially yield better solutions when constructing a solution. 

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])

    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))

    distance_weight = 0.45  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.25  # Weight for the demand factor
    centrality_weight = 0.3  # Weight for the centrality factor

    # Calculate degree centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)

    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY

            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand_ratio = demand_ratio / max_demand
            normalized_position = (j - 1) / (n_nodes - 1)

            heuristic_distance = normalized_distance ** distance_weight
            heuristic_demand = normalized_demand_ratio ** demand_weight
            heuristic_position = normalized_position * (1 - distance_weight - demand_weight)

            # Calculate centrality factor
            centrality_factor = centrality[j]

            heuristics[i, j] = heuristic_distance + heuristic_demand + heuristic_position + centrality_weight * centrality_factor
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```

In this modified scoring function, an additional `centrality_weight` parameter is introduced to determine the importance of the centrality factor. The degree centrality of each node is calculated using the `degree_centrality()` function from the `networkx` library. The centrality factor is then incorporated into the heuristic measure by multiplying it with the `centrality_weight`. The final heuristic measure is the sum of the distance, demand, position, and centrality factors.
