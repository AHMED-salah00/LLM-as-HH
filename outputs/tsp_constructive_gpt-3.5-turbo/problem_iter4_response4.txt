Code description: In this code, I will design a novel selecting-next-node function using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal is to select the next node based on the combination of the attractiveness of each unvisited node and the pheromone levels, similar to Algorithm 2. However, I will introduce a novel pheromone update mechanism to enhance the exploration and exploitation capabilities.

I will start by initializing a parameter called evaporation_rate, which determines the rate at which pheromone evaporates. In each iteration, I will calculate the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the modified distance matrix and the pheromone levels, similar to Algorithm 2.

To enhance exploration, I will update the pheromone levels using a novel mechanism called "pheromone reinforcement". For every node visited, I will update the pheromone level between the current node and all unvisited nodes based on the attractiveness of the unvisited nodes. The pheromones will be reinforced more for nodes that have higher attractiveness.

Finally, I will select the next node based on the attractiveness and pheromone levels. I will use a combination of attractiveness and pheromone levels to calculate the probability distribution for selecting the next node. The pheromone levels will have a higher weight in the calculation to enhance exploitation, while attractiveness will enhance exploration. I will select the next node probabilistically based on the probability distribution calculated.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    nxt_node = None
    evaporation_rate = 0.01  # Rate at which pheromone evaporates
    
    # Calculate modified distance matrix
    unvisited_count_matrix = distance_matrix.copy()
    unvisited_count_matrix[:, list(unvisited_nodes)] += len(unvisited_nodes) - 1
    
    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = (1 / unvisited_count_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)])
    
    # Update pheromone levels using pheromone reinforcement
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        reinforce_val = attractiveness[node]
        pheromone_matrix[current_node, node] += reinforce_val
    
    # Calculate probability distribution for selecting the next node
    pheromone_weight = 2.0  # Weight for pheromone levels
    attractiveness_weight = 1.0  # Weight for attractiveness
    total_weights = np.power(pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)], pheromone_weight) * np.power(attractiveness, attractiveness_weight)
    probability = total_weights / np.sum(total_weights)
    
    # Select next node based on probability distribution
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probability)
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: This code introduces a novel pheromone update mechanism called "pheromone reinforcement" to enhance exploration and exploitation. The key idea is to update the pheromone levels based on the attractiveness of the unvisited nodes.
