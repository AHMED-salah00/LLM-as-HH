Code description: 

In this improved scoring function, I will introduce a novel approach to calculate the heuristic measures for each edge. The key idea is to consider both the inverse distance and the degree centrality of the nodes connected by the edge. By combining these two factors, we can prioritize edges that are both short in distance and connected to nodes with higher centrality.

The steps involved in the scoring function are as follows:

1. Compute the inverse of the distance matrix.
2. Compute the degree centrality of each node.
3. Compute the edge importance measure by multiplying the inverse distance matrix with the average of the degree centrality of the source and destination nodes.
4. Normalize the edge importance measure so that it sums up to 1.
5. Return the edge importance measure.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = inverse_distance_matrix * ((degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis] + degree_centrality[np.newaxis, :]) / 2)
    
    # Normalize the edge importance measure
    edge_importance /= np.sum(edge_importance)
    
    return edge_importance
```
