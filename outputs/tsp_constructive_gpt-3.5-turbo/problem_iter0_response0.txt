Code description: 

This code implements a selecting-next-node function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a novel algorithm called "Randomized Greedy". 

The "Randomized Greedy" algorithm randomly selects a node from the set of unvisited nodes. The selection is based on a weighted probability, where the weight of each node is determined by its distance to the current node. The closer the node, the higher its weight. 

The algorithm calculates the cumulative probability distribution for all unvisited nodes based on their distances. It then generates a random number and selects the node whose cumulative probability is greater than the random number. This ensures that nodes that are closer to the current node have a higher chance of being selected. 

The algorithm returns the selected node as the next node to visit.
