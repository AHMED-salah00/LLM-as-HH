Code description: The crossover algorithm combines the best features of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective scoring function. It calculates the closeness centrality of each node using Algorithm 1 and incorporates the clustering structure of the nodes using Algorithm 2. Additionally, it adjusts the weights of the factors based on their importance.

This new scoring function combines the approach of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It calculates the closeness centrality of each node using Algorithm 1 and incorporates the clustering structure of the nodes using Algorithm 2. The closeness centrality is normalized and the clustering factor is also normalized using the maximum cluster distance. The demand factor is used as a penalty if the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity. The weights of the factors are adjusted based on their relative importance.
