Code description: 

The given algorithm uses the Degree-weighted Random Selection heuristic to select the next node. It assigns a weight to each unvisited node based on its degree and a random number, and then selects the next node randomly based on these weights. However, this algorithm can be further improved by introducing a measure of the proximity between the current node and the unvisited nodes. This measure can help in prioritizing the nodes that are closer to the current node, leading to potentially better solutions.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the degree for each unvisited node
    degree = np.zeros(len(distance_matrix))

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        degree[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
    
    # Calculate the proximity of unvisited nodes to the current node
    proximity = np.zeros(len(distance_matrix))

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        proximity[node] = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
    
    # Calculate the weights for all unvisited nodes based on the inverse of the degree and proximity
    weights = (1 / (degree * proximity))

    # Normalize the weights to probabilities
    probabilities = weights / np.sum(weights)

    # Select the next node based on the probabilities
    next_node = np.random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes), p=probabilities)
    
    return next_node
```
In the modified code, we first calculate the degree of each unvisited node. Then, we calculate the proximity of the unvisited nodes to the current node by using the distance matrix. The proximity measure can help prioritize the nodes that are closer to the current node. We then calculate weights for each unvisited node by taking the inverse of the product of degree and proximity. These weights are then normalized to obtain probabilities, and the next node is selected randomly based on these probabilities.
