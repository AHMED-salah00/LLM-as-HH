Write a scoring function for {problem_description}.
The function should output heuristic measures, which are non-negative real values. A higher value indicates that including the solution component during solution construction is more promising.
The scoring function should map inputs to a heuristic matrix. This matrix will be used to randomly sample solutions, where the elements of the matrix represent unnormalized probabilities.
The function signature is as follows:
{func_signature}
