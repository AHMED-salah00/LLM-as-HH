Code description: 

In this improved scoring function, I propose to incorporate two additional factors into the heuristic measure calculation: the closeness to the depot and the remaining capacity of the vehicle. The intuition behind this is as follows:
- Closeness to the depot: An edge that is closer to the depot is generally more favorable as it reduces the total distance traveled by the vehicle.
- Remaining capacity: An edge with a lower demand is more favorable as it has a higher chance of being served without exceeding the vehicle's capacity.

To incorporate these factors, I will calculate the average distance of each node from the depot. Then, I will calculate the distance ratio between the nodes on an edge and the average distance from the depot. Similarly, I will calculate the demand ratio, which is the demand of a node divided by the maximum demand. I will then calculate the heuristic measure as the sum of inverse distance ratio, inverse demand ratio, the remaining capacity (scaled between 0 and 1), and a weight term that balances the importance of all factors.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix, axis=0)[0]
    
    max_demand = np.max(demands)
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.3  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.3  # Weight for the demand factor
    capacity_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the remaining capacity factor
    closeness_weight = 0.2  # Weight for the closeness factor
    
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand = demands[j]
            remaining_capacity = CAPACITY - demand
            
            distance_ratio = distance / avg_distance
            demand_ratio = demand / max_demand
            
            inverse_distance_ratio = 1 / distance_ratio
            inverse_demand_ratio = 1 / demand_ratio
            
            heuristic_measure = (
                inverse_distance_ratio ** distance_weight +
                inverse_demand_ratio ** demand_weight +
                closeness_weight * (2 - distance_ratio) +
                capacity_weight * (remaining_capacity / CAPACITY)
            )
            
            heuristics[i, j] = heuristic_measure
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristic_measure
    
    return heuristics
```
NOTE: In the code, I have chosen initial weights for each factor based on expert knowledge. These weights can be adjusted based on the specific problem instance or tested through experimentation to find the optimal weights.
