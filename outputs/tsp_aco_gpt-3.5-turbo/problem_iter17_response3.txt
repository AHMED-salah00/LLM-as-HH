Code description: In my improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a novel approach for calculating the heuristic measures for each edge. The key idea is to consider the inverse distance, degree centrality, and closeness centrality of the nodes connected by the edge. By combining these three factors, we can prioritize edges that are both short in distance, connected to nodes with higher centrality, and have nodes that are close to other nodes.

The steps involved in the scoring function are as follows:

1. Compute the inverse of the distance matrix.
2. Compute the degree centrality of each node.
3. Compute the closeness centrality of each node.
4. Compute the edge importance measure by multiplying the inverse distance matrix with the average of the degree centrality of the source and destination nodes, and the closeness centrality of the source node.
5. Normalize the edge importance measure so that it sums up to 1.
6. Return the edge importance measure.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csgraph

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the closeness centrality of each node
    closeness_centrality = csgraph.shortest_path(distance_matrix, directed=False)
    closeness_centrality = 1 / np.average(closeness_centrality, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = inverse_distance_matrix * ((degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis] + closeness_centrality[np.newaxis, :]) / 2)
    
    # Normalize the edge importance measure
    edge_importance /= np.sum(edge_importance)
    
    return edge_importance
```
