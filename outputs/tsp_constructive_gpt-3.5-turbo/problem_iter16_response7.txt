Code description: The novel algorithm I propose is called "Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP)". It is an iterative improvement algorithm that aims to find good solutions to optimization problems by combining greedy construction with randomization.

In this algorithm, the select_next_node function selects the next node to visit by considering both the cost of insertion and a random element. First, the code initializes the minimum_cost variable to infinity and the nxt_node variable to -1. Then, it iterates over each unvisited node and calculates the cost of inserting the node into the tour between the current_node and destination_node. However, instead of directly comparing the cost with the minimum_cost, the algorithm introduces a random element by using a random_coefficient.

The random_coefficient is a float number between 0 and 1. It randomly adjusts the cost by adding a random value between 0 and a maximum random_value. This introduces variability into the selection process and allows the algorithm to explore different paths. The maximum random_value is determined by multiplying a randomization_factor with the average distance between unvisited nodes.

If the cost (adjusted by the random_coefficient) is lower than the current minimum_cost, or if the cost is equal to the minimum_cost but the random_coefficient is higher, the minimum_cost and nxt_node variables are updated with the new values.

Finally, the code returns the nxt_node as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    minimum_cost = float('inf')
    nxt_node = -1
    
    # Parameters for randomization
    randomization_factor = 0.1
    
    # Calculate the average distance between unvisited nodes
    avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)])
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        random_coefficient = np.random.rand()
        
        # Calculate the cost of inserting the node with the random element
        cost = distance_matrix[current_node][node] + distance_matrix[node][destination_node] - distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node] + random_coefficient * randomization_factor * avg_distance
        
        if cost < minimum_cost or (cost == minimum_cost and random_coefficient > 0.5):
            minimum_cost = cost
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
