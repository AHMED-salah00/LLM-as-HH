Write a vanilla "greedy" algorithm for this problem. Enclose your code in triple backticks like this: "```python ... ```"

Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- You must keep the input variables unchanged. For example, ensure the selected node remains within the unvisited nodes.
