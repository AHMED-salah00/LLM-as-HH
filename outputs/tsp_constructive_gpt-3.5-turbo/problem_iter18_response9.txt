Code description: In this code, I propose a novel selection algorithm that combines the features of the two provided algorithms to select the next node. The algorithm considers both direct distance and destination distance, as well as a modified version of Greedy Squeezing distance. Additionally, it incorporates a factor that favors nodes with lower average neighbor distances. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on these factors and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate average neighbor distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.35 * direct_distances + 0.3 * destination_distances + 0.2 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.15 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: I have adjusted the weights used to calculate the combined scores to give more importance to direct distance and destination distance, while still considering the modified Greedy Squeezing distance and average neighbor distance. The new weights are 0.35 for direct distance, 0.3 for destination distance, 0.2 for modified Greedy Squeezing distance, and 0.15 for average neighbor distance.
