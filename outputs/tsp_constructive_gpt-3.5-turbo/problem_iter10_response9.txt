Code description: 

The proposed algorithm, named "Weighted Distance with Uncertainty and Degree" (WDUD), selects the next node based on a weighted score that combines distance, uncertainty, and degree. It first calculates the degree and uncertainty scores for each unvisited node. Then, it calculates the weighted distances from the current node to each unvisited node, considering these factors. The node with the highest weighted distance is selected as the next node to visit.

The key improvement of this algorithm is considering both the uncertainty and the degree of each node. By doing so, it takes into account the uncertainty in the distance matrix and the connectivity of each node. This approach allows the algorithm to make more informed decisions in selecting the next node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using the Weighted Distance with Uncertainty and Degree heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.

    n_nodes = len(distance_matrix)
    
    # Calculate the degree for each unvisited node
    degree = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        degree[node] = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)

    uncertainty_scores = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
