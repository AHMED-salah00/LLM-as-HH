Code description: 

I propose a novel scoring function that combines the node degree measure, the edge centrality measure, and the average hop distance measure from the given algorithm. The goal is to further enhance the effectiveness of the scoring function in capturing both local and global information about the nodes and edges.

The modification I will make is to introduce a normalization step in the computation of the average hop distance. This will ensure that the range of values for the average hop distance measure is consistent with the other measures. 

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the node degree measure
    node_degree = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the average hop distance
    avg_hop_distance = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=float)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        avg_hop_distance += hop * (distance_matrix <= hop)
    avg_hop_distance /= (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Normalize the average hop distance
    max_hop_distance = np.max(avg_hop_distance)
    avg_hop_distance /= max_hop_distance
    
    # Compute the edge centrality measure
    edge_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)
    
    # Repeat the node degrees for each edge
    node_degrees = np.repeat(node_degree[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (node_degrees / avg_hop_distance) * edge_centrality[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
