Code description: In this code, I propose an improved version of the select_next_node function that takes into account both the direct distance and the connectivity of each unvisited node. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on the direct distance and the average neighbor connectivity. The node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate connectivities for each unvisited node
    connectivities = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_count = len(distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))])
        connectivities[node] = neighbor_count / (len(unvisited_nodes) - 1)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.7 * direct_distances + 0.3 * np.array(list(connectivities.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

The proposed algorithm calculates the direct distance from the current node to each unvisited node, and the connectivity of each unvisited node. It then calculates a combined score for each unvisited node, which is a weighted combination of the direct distance and the connectivity. The node with the highest combined score is selected as the next node to visit.
