Code description: The following code selects the next node to visit based on a combination of the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes. It calculates a score for each unvisited node based on this combination and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes based on a combination of distances.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """

    # Compute the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes
    avg_distances = np.mean(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=1)

    # Compute the distance from the current node to each unvisited node
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Calculate a score for each unvisited node based on the combination of distances
    scores = distances / avg_distances * distances

    # Select the node with the highest score as the next node to visit
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]

    return nxt_node
```

The novel algorithm selects the next node to visit by considering both the distance from the current node to each unvisited node and the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes. It calculates a score for each unvisited node by dividing the distance from the current node by the average distance and multiplying it by the distance itself. This score balances the importance of visiting nodes that are closer to the current node with nodes that are closer to the average distance. The algorithm selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.
