Code description: 
In this code, I propose a novel approach for selecting the next node to visit. The algorithm considers the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, as well as the distance from each unvisited node to the destination node. Instead of calculating the average distance between unvisited nodes, it considers the minimum distance between each pair of unvisited nodes. The node with the highest score, which is a combination of the current distance, the destination distance, and the minimum neighbor distance, is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance between each pair of unvisited nodes
    unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the minimum distance between each pair of unvisited nodes
    min_neighbor_distances = np.min(unvisited_distances, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    scores = 0.5 * current_distances - 0.3 * destination_distances - 0.2 * min_neighbor_distances
    
    # Find the node with the highest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
