Code description: This algorithm aims to select the next node based on a combination of uncertainty, distance, and the potential to connect unvisited nodes. The uncertainty score is calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) of the distances to other nodes from the current node. The distance score is the inverse of the distance from the current node to each unvisited node. The potential score is calculated as the sum of the distances from each unvisited node to other unvisited nodes. These scores are combined using equal weights, and the node with the highest weighted score will be selected as the next node to visit.

import numpy as np
