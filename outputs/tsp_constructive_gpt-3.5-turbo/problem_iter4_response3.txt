Code description: The code aims to improve the selection of the next node by taking into account both the distances between nodes and the attractiveness based on the pheromone levels. It incorporates elements from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more balanced and effective solution.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    alpha = 1.0
    beta = 1.0
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels
    attractiveness = pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]**alpha / distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]**beta

    # Calculate probability distribution for selecting the next node
    probability = attractiveness / np.sum(attractiveness)

    # Select next node based on probability distribution
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(probability)]

    return nxt_node
```
