Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a more effective heuristic measure. The scoring function will consider distance, demand, position, clustering, and depot closeness to assign scores to each edge. By incorporating these factors, the function will provide a more accurate estimation of the potential of each edge.
