Code description: 

In this scoring function, I will incorporate the concepts of edge importance and edge similarity to create a more effective measure of each edge's potential usefulness. Edge importance is determined by the inverse of the edge distance, while edge similarity is measured by the number of common neighbors between the edge's endpoints. By considering both these factors, the scoring function aims to capture the significance of each edge in the TSP instance.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)

    # Compute the degree of each node
    node_degrees = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1) - 1  # Subtract 1 to exclude self-loop

    # Construct the graph using the distance matrix
    graph = nx.from_numpy_matrix(distance_matrix, create_using=nx.Graph)

    # Compute the number of common neighbors for each edge
    common_neighbors = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            common_neighbors[i, j] = len(list(nx.common_neighbors(graph, i, j)))

    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = inverse_distance_matrix

    # Compute the edge similarity measure
    edge_similarity = common_neighbors / np.sqrt(node_degrees[:, np.newaxis] * node_degrees)

    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = edge_importance * edge_similarity

    return heuristics
```

In this modified code, I have made the following changes:
1. The computation of node degrees has been modified to exclude the self-loop count.
2. The computation of edge similarity has been added to measure the number of common neighbors between edge endpoints.
3. The edge centrality measure has been replaced with the edge similarity measure.
4. The final heuristic measures are calculated as the product of edge importance and edge similarity.
