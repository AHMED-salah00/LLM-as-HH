Write a scoring function for {problem_description}.
The function should output heuristic measures, which are non-negative real values. Solution components (e.g., edges connecting node pairs) with higher values are more likely to be chosen during subsequent solution construction.
So, your output heuristic measures should indicate how promising it is to include each solution component in a solution.
The function signature is as follows:
{func_signature}
