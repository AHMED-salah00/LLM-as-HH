Code description: This code aims to design a novel selecting-next-node function by using a probability-based approach that takes into account both the attractiveness of each unvisited node and the distance to the destination node. The goal is to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search space.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    alpha = 1.0
    beta = 1.0

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix[current_node])
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_node = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node, destination_node]
        attractiveness[node] = distance_to_destination / (distance_to_node**alpha)

    # Normalize attractiveness
    total_attractiveness = np.sum(attractiveness)
    attractiveness /= total_attractiveness

    # Select next node probabilistically based on attractiveness
    p = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
    cumulative_prob = 0
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        cumulative_prob += attractiveness[node]
        if p <= cumulative_prob:
            nxt_node = node
            break

    return nxt_node
```
