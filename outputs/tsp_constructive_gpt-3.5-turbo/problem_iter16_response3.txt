Code description: The following algorithm selects the next node to visit based on a combination of factors: distance to the current node, distance to the destination node, and the information gain of visiting each unvisited node. The algorithm first calculates the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes, then calculates the distances from each unvisited node to the destination node. It then calculates the information gain of visiting each unvisited node, which is the difference between the total distance of the unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes and the total distance of the current node to all other unvisited nodes. The node with the highest information gain is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distances from current node to all unvisited nodes
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distances from unvisited nodes to destination node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes), destination_node]
    
    # Calculate total distance of the current node to all other unvisited nodes
    current_total_distance = np.sum(current_distances)
    
    # Calculate total distance of each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes
    unvisited_total_distances = np.sum(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=1)
    
    # Calculate information gain for each unvisited node
    information_gain = unvisited_total_distances - current_total_distance
    
    # Select node with highest information gain as the next node to visit
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(information_gain)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
