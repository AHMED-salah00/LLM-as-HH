Code description: 

In this modified scoring function, I will incorporate the idea of both the clustering structure of the nodes and the centrality measure into the heuristics calculation. I will use the Louvain community detection algorithm to capture the clustering structure of the nodes. I will normalize the clustering factor using the maximum cluster distance. I will normalize the centrality measure by dividing it by the maximum centrality value. I will eliminate the demand ratio constraint and instead use the demand factor as a penalty if the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity. I will adjust the weights of the factors based on their relative importance.

In this modified scoring function, I have replaced the spectral clustering with the Louvain community detection algorithm to capture the clustering structure of the nodes. I have calculated the clustering factor by assigning the maximum distance between clusters and normalizing it by the maximum distance in the distance matrix. I have replaced the closeness centrality with the centrality measure calculated using the closeness_centrality function from the NetworkX library. I have normalized the centrality measure by dividing it by the maximum centrality value. I have eliminated the demand ratio constraint and instead used a demand factor as a penalty if the demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity. Finally, I have adjusted the weights of the factors based on their relative importance.
