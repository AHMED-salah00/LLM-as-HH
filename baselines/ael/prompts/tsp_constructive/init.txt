Provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The code function must called 'select_next_node' that takes inputs 'current_node', 'destination_node', 'unvisited_nodes', and 'distance_matrix', and outputs the 'next_node', where 'current_node', 'destination_node', 'next_node', and 'unvisited_nodes' are node id. 

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
