Code description: This crossover algorithm combines the best features of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, while making some additional modifications to enhance the scoring function. It calculates the closeness centrality of each node using Algorithm 1, incorporates the clustering structure of the nodes using Algorithm 2, and introduces a new factor called "degree centrality". The weights of the factors are adjusted based on their importance.

Modifications to the code:
1. Introduce a new parameter "degree_centrality_weight" to control the weight of the degree centrality factor.
2. Calculate the degree centrality of each node based on the number of adjacent edges.
3. Include the degree centrality factor in the calculation of the heuristic measure.

This code crossover takes the closeness centrality calculation from Algorithm 1, incorporates the clustering factor from Algorithm 2, and introduces a new factor called "degree centrality". The weights of all factors are adjusted based on their importance. The resulting scoring function provides a more comprehensive evaluation of each edge before solving the optimization problem.
