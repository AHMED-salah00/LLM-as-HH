Code description: The novel algorithm I propose selects the next node based on a combination of the distance to the node, the closeness centrality of the node, and the number of unvisited neighboring nodes. The algorithm aims to balance between visiting close nodes, which helps minimize the distance traveled, and visiting nodes with many unvisited neighbors, which increases the potential for finding better solutions.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the closeness centrality of each unvisited node
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(nx.Graph(distance_matrix))
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[node] > 0)))
        score = distance + closeness_centrality[node] + num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
The modified algorithm assigns a score to each unvisited node by adding the following components:
1. The distance from the current node to the unvisited node.
2. The closeness centrality of the unvisited node, which measures how quickly information can spread from that node to all other nodes.
3. The number of unvisited neighboring nodes of the unvisited node. This component encourages visiting nodes that have a higher potential for finding additional unvisited nodes nearby.

The algorithm then selects the unvisited node with the highest score as the next node to visit.
