Code description: 
The code below proposes a modification to the original algorithm. It takes into account the distance from the current node to each unvisited node, the degree centrality of each unvisited node, and the attractiveness score of each unvisited node based on their distance and degree centrality. The modified algorithm aims to select the next node that not only has a low distance but also a high degree centrality and attractiveness score.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate the attractiveness score for each unvisited node
    attractiveness_scores = 0.7 * current_distances - 0.3 * np.array([degree_centralities[node] for node in unvisited_nodes])
    
    # Find the node with the highest attractiveness score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(attractiveness_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

The modified algorithm assigns a higher weight (0.7) to the current distances and a lower weight (0.3) to the degree centrality. This is to prioritize nodes that are not only close but also well-connected to the rest of the nodes. The selected node is the one with the highest attractiveness score, which is calculated as a combination of the distance and degree centrality.
