Code description: 

In this modified scoring function, I propose to combine the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The new scoring function incorporates the concepts of hop count, average distance of connected nodes, sum of distances to other nodes, edge centrality, and normalized heuristic measures. By considering these factors, the scoring function aims to provide more accurate and effective heuristic measures for each edge.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the normalized heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristic_measures = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count) / edge_scores
    normalized_heuristics = heuristic_measures / np.sum(heuristic_measures, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    
    # Calculate edge centrality score
    centrality_score = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)
    
    # Multiply the centrality score with normalized heuristic measures
    heuristics = normalized_heuristics * centrality_score[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
```
