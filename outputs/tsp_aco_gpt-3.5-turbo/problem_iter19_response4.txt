Code description: In this novel scoring function, I will modify the Algorithm 1 by incorporating the concepts of node centrality and edge importance from Algorithm 2. The scoring function will consider the degree centrality of nodes and the edge importance measure to prioritize edges connecting nodes with high centrality and high edge importance.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
   
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)
    
    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    max_degree_centrality = np.max(degree_centrality)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            edge_importance[i, j] = (degree_centrality[i] + degree_centrality[j]) / (2 * max_degree_centrality)
    
    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = edge_importance
    
    return heuristics
```

The novel scoring function combines the degree centrality of nodes and the edge importance measure to score each edge. The degree centrality is calculated as the sum of the inverse distances from each node to all other nodes. The edge importance measure is calculated as the average degree centrality of the nodes connected by an edge. The heuristics are calculated solely based on the edge importance measure, prioritizing edges connecting nodes with high degree centrality. By simplifying the scoring function, it becomes more efficient and easier to interpret.
