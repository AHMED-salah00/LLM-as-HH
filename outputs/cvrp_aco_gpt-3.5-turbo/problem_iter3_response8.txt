Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will include an additional factor that considers the clustering structure of the nodes. This clustering factor will assign higher scores to edges that connect nodes that belong to the same cluster. I will also introduce a variable that controls the weight of the clustering factor. Additionally, I will initialize the heuristics matrix outside the loop for efficiency.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.7
    demand_weight = 0.3
    clustering_weight = 0.1
    
    # Calculate clustering factor
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])
    
    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i-1] == cluster_labels[j-1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = max_distance
                cluster_distances[j, i] = max_distance
    
    # Calculate heuristic measures
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            cluster_distance = cluster_distances[i, j]
            
            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = 0
            else:
                inverted_distance = 1 / distance
                clustering_factor = np.exp(-cluster_distance / max_distance)
                heuristics[i, j] = distance_weight * inverted_distance + demand_weight * demand_ratio + clustering_weight * clustering_factor
            
            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]
    
    return heuristics
```

Note: In this improved scoring function, I have added a clustering factor that assigns higher scores to edges connecting nodes belonging to the same cluster. I have used the KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn to cluster the nodes into three clusters. The clustering factor is calculated by taking the exponential of the negative cluster distance divided by the maximum distance. The weight of the clustering factor is controlled by the `clustering_weight` variable.
