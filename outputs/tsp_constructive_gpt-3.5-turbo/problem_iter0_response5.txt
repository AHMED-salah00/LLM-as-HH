Code description: 

The code implements a novel heuristic for selecting the next node in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The heuristic is called Randomized Greedy Shortest Path (RGSP). It starts from the current node and calculates the shortest path to each unvisited node. It then randomly selects one of the unvisited nodes that has the shortest path length. This introduces randomization into the greedy selection process, which can help avoid getting trapped in local optima. The code uses the distance matrix to calculate the shortest paths between nodes.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the shortest path length from current node to each unvisited node
    shortest_paths = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        shortest_paths[node] = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
    
    # Find the shortest path length among all unvisited nodes
    min_path_length = min(shortest_paths.values())
    
    # Filter the unvisited nodes that have the shortest path length
    shortest_nodes = [node for node, path_length in shortest_paths.items() if path_length == min_path_length]
    
    # Select one of the shortest node randomly
    nxt_node = random.choice(shortest_nodes)
    
    return nxt_node
```
