Code description: In this modified algorithm, we introduce a metric called "exploratory factor" which measures the balance between visiting nodes that are already close to the current node and exploring nodes that are farther away. The exploratory factor is calculated as the average distance from the current node to all unvisited nodes divided by the maximum distance. The node with the highest exploratory factor is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the attractiveness and closeness centrality in advance
    attractiveness_dict = {}
    closeness_centrality_dict = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        attractiveness = distance_destination - distance_current
        attractiveness_dict[node] = attractiveness
        
        # Create a subgraph with only the unvisited nodes
        unvisited_distance_matrix = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)]
        
        # Calculate the closeness centrality of each unvisited node
        unvisited_graph = nx.Graph(unvisited_distance_matrix)
        closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(unvisited_graph)
        closeness_centrality_dict[node] = closeness_centrality[node]
    
    # Calculate the exploratory factor for each unvisited node
    exploratory_factor_dict = {}
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)])
        exploratory_factor = avg_distance / max_distance
        exploratory_factor_dict[node] = exploratory_factor
    
    # Select the next node based on attractiveness, closeness centrality, and exploratory factor
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[node] > 0)))
        
        # Calculate the score based on attractiveness, closeness centrality, and exploratory factor
        score = attractiveness_dict[node] + closeness_centrality_dict[node] + exploratory_factor_dict[node] + num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```

In the modified code, we first calculate the attractiveness and closeness centrality values for each unvisited node, similar to the original algorithm. We then introduce a new step where we calculate the exploratory factor for each unvisited node. The exploratory factor is calculated as the average distance from the current node to all unvisited nodes divided by the maximum distance in the distance matrix.

Next, we select the next node based on a combination of attractiveness, closeness centrality, exploratory factor, and the number of unvisited neighbors. Each factor is given equal weight in the scoring calculation, resulting in a comprehensive evaluation of the next node to visit. The node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.
