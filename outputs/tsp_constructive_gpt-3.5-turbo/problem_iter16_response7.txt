Code description: The proposed code aims to improve the selection of the next node by taking into account the distance from the current node to unvisited nodes, the distance from the destination node to unvisited nodes, and the modified greedy squeezing distance. To make the selection more dynamic and robust, the code incorporates an adaptive weight factor that adjusts based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.4 * direct_distances - 0.3 * destination_distances + 0.3 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
