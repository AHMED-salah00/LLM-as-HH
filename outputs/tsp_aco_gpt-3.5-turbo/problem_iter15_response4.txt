Code description: In my improved scoring function, I will combine the edge importance measure from Algorithm 1 with the eigenvector centrality measure from Algorithm 2. The edge importance measure captures the significance of each edge based on the importance of its endpoints, while the eigenvector centrality measure assigns higher scores to edges leading to nodes that are more central in the graph. By combining these two measures, I aim to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of each edge's potential usefulness in the TSP instance.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.

    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)

    # Compute the degree centrality of each node
    degree_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)

    # Compute the total centrality of each node
    total_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)

    # Compute the edge importance measure
    edge_importance = inverse_distance_matrix * (degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis] + degree_centrality[np.newaxis, :])

    # Create the graph from the distance matrix
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)

    # Calculate the eigenvector centrality of each node
    eig_centrality = nx.eigenvector_centrality_numpy(G)

    # Calculate the heuristic measures by combining the edge importance measure and eigenvector centrality measure
    heuristics = edge_importance * eig_centrality

    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)

    return heuristics
