Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- Note that your scoring function outputs heuristic measures before solution construction. Therefore, no information about partial solutions can be utilized.
- Leave your output unnormalized.
