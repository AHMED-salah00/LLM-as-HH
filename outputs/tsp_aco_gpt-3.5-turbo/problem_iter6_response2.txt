Code description: In the improved scoring function, I will use the concept of edge centrality to assign heuristic measures to each edge. Edge centrality measures the importance of an edge in a network, and it can be calculated based on the shortest paths between nodes. First, I will compute the shortest path lengths between all nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Then, I will calculate the edge centrality for each edge by summing the inverse of the shortest path lengths that include the edge. Finally, I will normalize the edge centrality measures to have values between 0 and 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the shortest path lengths between all nodes using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    shortest_paths = np.copy(distance_matrix)
    for k in range(n_nodes):
        for i in range(n_nodes):
            for j in range(n_nodes):
                shortest_paths[i, j] = min(shortest_paths[i, j], shortest_paths[i, k] + shortest_paths[k, j])
    
    # Calculate the edge centrality for each edge
    edge_centrality = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            if i != j:
                for k in range(n_nodes):
                    if k != i and k != j:
                        edge_centrality[i, j] += 1 / shortest_paths[i, k] + 1 / shortest_paths[k, j]
    
    # Normalize the edge centrality measures to have values between 0 and 1
    heuristics = edge_centrality / np.max(edge_centrality)
    
    return heuristics
```

Note: I have removed the import statements for np and networkx, as they are not used in the improved scoring function.
