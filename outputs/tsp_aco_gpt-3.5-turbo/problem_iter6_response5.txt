Code description: 

I will combine the features from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a novel scoring function. The new scoring function will consider the degree of nodes, hop count between nodes, centrality score, normalization, and the sum of distances to other nodes for each node. Additionally, I will optimize the calculation of the hop count using the scipy library to compute the shortest path lengths between nodes.
