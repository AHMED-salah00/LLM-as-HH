Code description: The modified scoring function aims to improve upon the original by incorporating additional factors that can contribute to the quality of the heuristics. Specifically, it takes into account the position of the nodes, in addition to the distance and demand. The idea is that nodes that are closer to the depot (index 0) are more desirable because they can potentially reduce the travel time and distance.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Initialize heuristics matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Maximum values for normalization
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])
    
    # Weight parameters for distance, demand, and position
    distance_weight = 0.4
    demand_weight = 0.4
    position_weight = 0.2
    
    # Calculate the position factor for each node
    positions = (np.arange(n_nodes) + 1) / n_nodes
    
    # Calculate heuristic measures for each edge
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(i+1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand = demands[j]
            
            # Calculate normalized distance, demand, and position
            normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
            normalized_demand = demand / max_demand
            normalized_position = positions[j]
            
            # Calculate heuristic score as weighted sum
            score = distance_weight * normalized_distance + demand_weight * normalized_demand + position_weight * normalized_position
            
            # Apply penalty for infeasible solutions
            if demand > CAPACITY:
                score = 0
            
            # Update heuristics matrix
            heuristics[i, j] = score
    
    # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
    heuristics += np.tril(heuristics.T, -1)
    
    return heuristics
```

The modified scoring function introduces a new factor called "position_weight", which is a weight parameter for the position of the nodes. The position factor is calculated for each node by dividing its index by the total number of nodes. This factor is added to the existing weighted sum calculation to incorporate the importance of node positions.

By adjusting the weights for distance, demand, and position, the scoring function can be fine-tuned to prioritize different aspects of the problem. For example, a higher distance weight would prioritize shorter paths, while a higher demand weight would prioritize serving nodes with higher demand. Similarly, a higher position weight would prioritize nodes that are closer to the depot.
