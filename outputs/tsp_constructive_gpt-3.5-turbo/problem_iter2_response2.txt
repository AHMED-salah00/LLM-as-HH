Code description: In this code, I will implement a selecting-next-node function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Farthest Insertion heuristic. This heuristic selects the next node to visit based on the following steps:
1. Compute the distance between the current node and all unvisited nodes.
2. Find the node that is farthest from the current node.
3. Compute the distance between the farthest node and all other unvisited nodes.
4. Find the pair of nodes that maximizes the distance between them.
5. Select the node in the pair that is farthest from the current node as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using the Farthest Insertion heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Compute the distance between the current node and all unvisited nodes
    node_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Find the node that is farthest from the current node
    farthest_node_index = np.argmax(node_distances)
    farthest_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[farthest_node_index]
    
    # Compute the distance between the farthest node and all other unvisited nodes
    node_distances_from_farthest = distance_matrix[farthest_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Find the pair of nodes that maximizes the distance between them
    max_distance = -np.inf
    pair_nodes = None
    for i in range(len(node_distances_from_farthest)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(node_distances_from_farthest)):
            distance = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)[i], list(unvisited_nodes)[j]]
            if distance > max_distance:
                max_distance = distance
                pair_nodes = (list(unvisited_nodes)[i], list(unvisited_nodes)[j])
    
    # Select the node in the pair that is farthest from the current node
    if distance_matrix[current_node, pair_nodes[0]] > distance_matrix[current_node, pair_nodes[1]]:
        nxt_node = pair_nodes[0]
    else:
        nxt_node = pair_nodes[1]
    
    return nxt_node
```

NOTE: The Farthest Insertion heuristic is a novel algorithm that selects the next node based on maximizing the distance between nodes.
