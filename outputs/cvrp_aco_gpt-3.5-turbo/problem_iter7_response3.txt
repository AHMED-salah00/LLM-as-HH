Code description: 
In this code, I will combine the key elements of both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a novel scoring function. The scoring function will include factors that capture the distance between nodes, the demand of nodes, the centrality of nodes, and the spatial proximity of nodes. I will adjust the weights assigned to these factors to optimize their importance in the scoring function.
