Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 and make further modifications to improve the effectiveness of the heuristics. The modified algorithm will have the following features:

1. Degree of nodes: Nodes with higher degrees indicate higher connectivity and importance. We will incorporate this information by including a term proportional to the inverse of the degree of the destination node.

2. Hop count between nodes: It represents the shortest number of edges that must be traversed to go from one node to another. Lower hop counts indicate easier accessibility between nodes and will be accounted for in the heuristic measures.

3. Centrality score: Centrality measures the importance or influence of a node in the network. We will calculate the centrality score by finding the sum of distances to other nodes.

4. Distance between nodes: Similar to Algorithm 2, we will calculate the inverse distance between nodes, considering the distance as a measure of priority.

5. Normalization: To ensure that the scoring function outputs values that sum up to 1, we will divide each heuristic measure by the sum of all heuristic measures.

6. Modification to the hop count calculation: The hop count calculation in Algorithm 1 is a brute force approach that checks for all possible hop counts. To make it more efficient, I will use the floyd_warshall() function from the scipy library to calculate the shortest path lengths between nodes and use that to compute the hop count between nodes.
