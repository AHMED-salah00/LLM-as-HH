Code description: The initial code provided already incorporates several factors such as inverse distances, node degrees, hop count, edge centrality, and edge diversity. However, I will modify the code to improve the calculation of edge diversity and introduce an additional factor: edge importance.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)

    # Compute the degree of each node
    node_degrees = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix, axis=1)

    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    
    # Construct the graph using the distance matrix
    graph = nx.from_numpy_matrix(distance_matrix, create_using=nx.Graph)

    # Calculate shortest path lengths using networkx library
    path_lengths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(graph))

    # Compute the hop count
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            hop_count[i, j] = path_lengths[i][j]

    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)

    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)

    # Compute the edge centrality measure
    edge_centrality = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix)

    # Improved computation of edge diversity
    edge_diversity = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            if distance_matrix[i, j] != 0:
                edge_diversity[i] += 1 / distance_matrix[i, j]
    
    # Normalize the edge diversity measure
    normalized_edge_diversity = edge_diversity / np.max(edge_diversity)

    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)

    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * (1 / node_degrees[:, np.newaxis]) * hop_count * edge_scores) / (edge_scores ** 2)

    # Multiply the node degrees with the heuristic measures
    heuristics *= node_degrees[:, np.newaxis]

    # Multiply the edge centrality with the heuristic measures
    heuristics *= edge_centrality[:, np.newaxis]

    # Incorporate edge importance into the heuristic measures
    edge_importance = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    max_node_score = np.max(node_scores)
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            edge_importance[i, j] = (node_scores[i] + node_scores[j]) / (2 * max_node_score)
    
    heuristics *= edge_importance

    # Add the weighted average of edge diversity to the heuristic measures
    alpha = 0.25
    heuristics += alpha * normalized_edge_diversity[:, np.newaxis]

    return heuristics
```

In this modified code, I improved the computation of edge diversity by summing inverse distances instead of counting the number of non-zero distance values. Additionally, I introduced the concept of edge importance by calculating a measure based on the sum of node scores for each edge. This is then multiplied with the existing heuristic measures to incorporate the importance factor.
