Code description: 

The proposed algorithm, called "Weighted Expected Improvement with Local Search", combines the key ideas from both algorithms to design a better heuristic. This algorithm calculates the expected improvement for each unvisited node based on the weighted distance, uncertainty score, and degree of the neighboring nodes. The algorithm then selects the node with the highest expected improvement as the next node to visit. The algorithm also incorporates the local search process from Algorithm 1 to explore the neighborhood of the current node for additional potential improvements.
