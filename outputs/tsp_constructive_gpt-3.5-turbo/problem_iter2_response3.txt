Code description: 
The modified code implements a novel selecting-next-node function for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The function selects the next node to visit based on a combination of three criteria: distance from the current node, distance to the destination node, and the number of unvisited neighboring nodes.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
