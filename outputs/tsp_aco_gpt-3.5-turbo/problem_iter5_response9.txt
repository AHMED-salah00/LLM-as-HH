Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a better scoring function. The scoring function will first calculate the inverse distances of each edge, similar to Algorithm 2. Then, instead of generating random permutations of nodes, I will use the heuristic measures calculated in Algorithm 1. The heuristic measures will now be obtained by multiplying the inverse distances with the heuristic measure of the destination node - the product of the inverse distance and the inverse number of connections. This way, I can take into account both the distance and the number of connections of the destination node, prioritizing edges that have a close destination node with fewer connections.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges.

    node_connections = np.zeros(n_nodes, dtype=int)
    for i in range(n_nodes):

        node_connections[i] = np.count_nonzero(distance_matrix[i])
