Code description: The code implements a selecting-next-node function for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by using a combination of the two given algorithms. It takes into account the distances from the current node, the destination node, and the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels. It aims to select the next node that is not only close to the current node and the destination node but also has a higher attractiveness based on the pheromone levels.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the destination node to all unvisited nodes
    dest_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to the destination node
    dest_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes added to the distance from the destination node to those unvisited nodes
    weighted_distances = distances + dest_distances
    
    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node based on the pheromone levels
    alpha = 1.0
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values
    attractiveness = np.exp(-alpha * pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)])

    # Calculate the combined attractiveness and weighted distance score for each unvisited node
    combined_score = attractiveness / weighted_distances
    
    # Find the index of the unvisited node with the maximum combined score
    max_index = np.argmax(combined_score)
    
    # Get the corresponding unvisited node
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[max_index]
    
    return nxt_node
```
