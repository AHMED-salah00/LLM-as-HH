Code description: In this modified version of the scoring function, I will adjust the weight coefficients for each factor to improve the heuristic measures. Specifically, I will focus on the capacity factor and introduce a new factor, proximity to the depot. I will also normalize the proximity to the depot factor using the maximum distance from the depot to any node.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]

    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    max_demand = np.max(demands[1:])
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Set weight coefficients for distance, demand, position, penalty, closeness, capacity, and depot proximity (optimized values)
    distance_weight = 0.4
    demand_weight = 0.2
    position_weight = 0.1
    penalty_weight = 0.05
    closeness_weight = 0.1
    capacity_weight = 0.05
    depot_proximity_weight = 0.1
    
    normalized_demands = demands[1:] / max_demand
    positions = np.arange(1, n_nodes) / n_nodes

    max_remaining_capacity = CAPACITY - np.min(demands)
    max_depot_proximity = np.max(distance_matrix[0, 1:])
    
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]

            if demands[j] > CAPACITY:
                heuristics[i, j] = 0
            else:
                normalized_distance = distance / max_distance
                penalty_factor = 1 - (demands[j] / CAPACITY)
                closeness_factor = 1 - (distance / max_distance)
                remaining_capacity = CAPACITY - demands[j]
                remaining_capacity_factor = remaining_capacity / max_remaining_capacity
                depot_proximity_factor = 1 - (distance_matrix[0, j] / max_depot_proximity)
                
                heuristics[i, j] = (
                    distance_weight * normalized_distance + 
                    demand_weight * normalized_demands[j-1] +
                    position_weight * positions[j-1] +
                    penalty_weight * penalty_factor +
                    closeness_weight * closeness_factor +
                    capacity_weight * remaining_capacity_factor +
                    depot_proximity_weight * depot_proximity_factor
                )
                
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]

    return heuristics
```

In this modified version of the scoring function, I adjusted the weight coefficients for each factor to improve the heuristic measures. The weight coefficients were optimized based on my knowledge of the problem domain and experimentation. The new factor, depot proximity, measures how close a node is to the depot and is normalized using the maximum distance from the depot to any node. This factor is included to capture the importance of considering the depot location in routing decisions.

The overall scoring function calculates the heuristic measure for each edge based on distance, demand, position, penalty, closeness, capacity, and depot proximity. The implementation follows the original logic but includes the additional depot proximity factor.
