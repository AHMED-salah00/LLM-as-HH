Code description: 

This code implements a novel heuristic for the selecting-next-node function in the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The heuristic uses a combination of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

The algorithm starts by calculating the MST of the unvisited nodes using Prim's algorithm. It then performs a DFS traversal starting from the current node to find the next unvisited node with the minimum distance to the current node. If there are multiple nodes with the same minimum distance, the algorithm selects the node that appears earliest in the DFS traversal.

The selected-next-node function returns the selected node as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Create a MST of the unvisited nodes
    mst = [current_node]
    while len(mst) < len(unvisited_nodes):
        min_dist = float('inf')
        min_node = None
        for node in mst:
            min_node_candidate = None
            for i, dist in enumerate(distances):
                if i in mst:
                    continue
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    min_node = i
                    min_node_candidate = i
            
            if min_node_candidate is not None:
                break
        
        mst.append(min_node)
    
    # Perform a DFS traversal from the current node to find the next node
    stack = [(current_node, mst)]
    while stack:
        current, path = stack.pop()
        if len(path) == 1:
            next_node = path[0]
            break
        neighbors = distance_matrix[current, :]
        min_dist = float('inf')
        min_node = None
        for node in path:
            if neighbors[node] < min_dist:
                min_dist = neighbors[node]
                min_node = node
        
        path.remove(min_node)
        stack.append((min_node, path))
    
    # Return the selected node as the next node to visit
    return next_node
```

The code first calculates the distance from the current node to each unvisited node. It then constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the unvisited nodes using Prim's algorithm. Next, it performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from the current node to find the next unvisited node with the minimum distance. Finally, it returns the selected node as the next node to visit.
