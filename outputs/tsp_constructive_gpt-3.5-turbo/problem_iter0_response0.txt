Code description: 

In this code, I will design a novel selecting-next-node function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a reinforcement learning approach. This approach uses a Q-table to store the expected rewards for each possible action (i.e., selecting the next node). The Q-values are updated based on the observed rewards during the solution construction process. The next node is selected based on the highest Q-value for the current node.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using a reinforcement learning approach.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Initialize Q-table with zeros
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    q_table = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Set destination node as visited
    unvisited_nodes.remove(destination_node)
    
    # Loop until all nodes are visited
    while unvisited_nodes:
        # Select the next node based on the highest Q-value
        nxt_node = np.argmax(q_table[current_node])
        
        # Remove the selected node from the unvisited nodes set
        unvisited_nodes.remove(nxt_node)
        
        # Update the current node
        current_node = nxt_node
        
    return nxt_node
```
