Code description: 

In this algorithm, I propose a new approach for selecting the next node to visit based on a combination of factors: distance to the current node, distance to the destination node, and the number of unvisited neighbors. 

The algorithm first calculates the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes, then calculates the distances from each unvisited node to the destination node. It also counts the number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node.

Then, for each unvisited node, it calculates a score as follows:
- It normalizes the distance from the current node to the unvisited node by dividing it by the maximum distance in the distance matrix.
- It normalizes the distance from the unvisited node to the destination node by dividing it by the maximum distance in the distance matrix.
- It calculates a neighbor score by normalizing the number of unvisited neighbors by dividing it by the maximum distance in the distance matrix.

The overall score for each unvisited node is calculated as a weighted sum of the normalized distances and the neighbor score. The weight factor can be adjusted to prioritize either the distance or the number of unvisited neighbors.

Finally, the algorithm selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    weight = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_current_node = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_destination_node = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        distance_current_node_norm = distance_current_node / np.max(distance_matrix)
        distance_destination_node_norm = distance_destination_node / np.max(distance_matrix)
        neighbors_norm = num_unvisited_neighbors / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        score = (1 - weight) * distance_current_node_norm + weight * (distance_destination_node_norm + neighbors_norm)
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
