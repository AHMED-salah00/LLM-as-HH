Code description: In this code, I propose a novel selecting-next-node algorithm that combines the ideas from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The algorithm calculates a score for each unvisited node based on direct distance, destination distance, Modified Greedy Squeezing distance, average neighbor distance, and density of unvisited nodes. It then selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.

    # Calculate direct distance from current node to each unvisited node
    direct_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate Modified Greedy Squeezing distance for each unvisited node
    mgs_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, destination_node]
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the weight based on the number of neighboring unvisited nodes
        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)
        
    # Calculate average neighbor distance for each unvisited node
    neighbor_distance = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        neighbor_distances = distance_matrix[node, list(unvisited_nodes - set([node]))]
        neighbor_distance[node] = np.mean(neighbor_distances)
        
    # Calculate density of unvisited nodes
    radius = np.mean(distance_matrix) / 2  # Set the radius as half of the mean distance
    
    density = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        node_coords = np.array([[distance_matrix[current_node][node], distance_matrix[node][destination_node]]])
        unvisited_coords = np.array([[distance_matrix[current_node][unvisited_node], distance_matrix[unvisited_node][destination_node]] for unvisited_node in unvisited_nodes])
        
        dists = cdist(node_coords, unvisited_coords)
        num_nodes = np.sum(dists < radius)
        
        density[node] = num_nodes / len(unvisited_nodes)
    
    # Calculate combined scores for each unvisited node
    combined_scores = 0.3 * direct_distances + 0.2 * destination_distances + 0.1 * np.array(list(mgs_distance.values())) + 0.1 * np.array(list(neighbor_distance.values())) + 0.3 * np.array(list(density.values()))
    
    # Find the node with the highest combined score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```

Note: This code combines the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 by considering multiple factors such as direct distance, destination distance, Modified Greedy Squeezing distance, average neighbor distance, and density of unvisited nodes to calculate a combined score for each unvisited node. The node with the highest combined score is then selected as the next node to visit.
