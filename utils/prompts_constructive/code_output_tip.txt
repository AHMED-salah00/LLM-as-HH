Some helpful tips for writing the scoring function code:
(1) Import necessary packages and do not modify the function signature.
(2) Be very creative and use the knowledge about the problem, if it is available.
(3) You may avoid always acting greedily.
(4) You may introduce new constants and IF statements into the scoring function if needed.
(5) You may modify the values of the constants.
(6) You may introduce sophisticated mechanisms into the function if necessary.
