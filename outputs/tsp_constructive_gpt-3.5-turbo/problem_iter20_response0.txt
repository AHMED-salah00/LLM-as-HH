Code description: The modified algorithm aims to incorporate both a diversity factor and a proximity factor in the selection of the next node. The diversity factor encourages exploration of unvisited nodes with fewer unvisited neighbors, similar to the original algorithm. The proximity factor biases the selection towards nodes that are closer to the current node and the destination node, with the assumption that nodes closer to these nodes are more likely to contribute to a better solution. The modified algorithm calculates a combined score based on these factors and selects the node with the smallest score.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node
    num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)] > 0, axis=1)
    
    # Calculate proximity factor based on combined distances to current node and destination node
    proximity_factor = current_distances + destination_distances
    
    # Calculate diversity factor based on number of unvisited neighbors
    diversity_factor = 1 / (num_unvisited_neighbors + 1)
    
    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the two factors
    score = 0.6 * proximity_factor - 0.4 * diversity_factor
    
    # Find the node with the smallest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(score)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
