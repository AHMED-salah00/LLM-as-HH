Code description: The modified algorithm introduces a novel node selection strategy based on the concept of proximity to both the current node and the destination node. It considers the distance to the current node, the distance to the destination node, and the number of unvisited neighbors to calculate a score for each unvisited node. The score is a weighted combination of these factors, and the node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    weight1 = 0.4
    weight2 = 0.3
    weight3 = 0.3
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        score = weight1 * (1 / distance_to_current) + weight2 * (1 / distance_to_destination) - weight3 * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
Note: The weights assigned to the distance factors and the number of unvisited neighbors can be adjusted based on the problem characteristics and performance requirements.
