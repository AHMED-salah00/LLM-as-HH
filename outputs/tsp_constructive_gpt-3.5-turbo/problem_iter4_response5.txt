Code description: 

The proposed algorithm combines elements from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 to create a hybrid algorithm for selecting the next node. The algorithm considers both the distances from the current node to each unvisited node and the inverse of the node's degree centrality to calculate a weighted distance. The node with the minimum weighted distance is selected as the next node to visit.

The algorithm first calculates the distances from the current node to each unvisited node and the degree centrality of all nodes. Then, it calculates the weighted distances for all unvisited nodes by multiplying the distance from the current node to the unvisited node with the inverse of its degree centrality. The node with the minimum weighted distance is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to each unvisited node
    curr_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate degree centrality of all nodes
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(graph)
    
    # Calculate the weighted distances for all unvisited nodes
    weighted_distances = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Calculate the distance from the current node to the unvisited node
        distance = curr_distances[node]
        
        # Calculate the weighted distance, where the distance is multiplied by the inverse of the degree centrality
        weighted_distance = distance * (1 / degree_centrality[node])
        weighted_distances[node] = weighted_distance
    
    # Find the node with the minimum weighted distance
    nxt_node = min(weighted_distances, key=weighted_distances.get)
    
    return nxt_node
```
