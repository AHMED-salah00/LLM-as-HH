Code description: 
This code implements a novel algorithm for selecting the next node to visit in the Traveling Salesman Problem. The algorithm selects the next node based on a metric that takes into account both the distance from the current node to the unvisited nodes and the distance from the unvisited nodes to the destination node. The node with the smallest metric value is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    # Calculate the distance from the current node to the unvisited nodes
    distance_from_current = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the unvisited nodes to the destination node
    distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes), destination_node]
    
    # Calculate the metric value for each node
    metric_values = distance_from_current + distance_to_destination
    
    # Find the node with the smallest metric value
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(metric_values)]
    
    return nxt_node
