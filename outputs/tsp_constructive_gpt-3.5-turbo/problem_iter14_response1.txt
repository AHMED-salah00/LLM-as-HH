Code description: 

In this code, I propose a novel selecting-next-node function that combines the advantages of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The goal is to select the next node based on a combination of factors including the Modified Greedy Squeezing (MGS) distance, the direct distance to the destination node, and the degree centrality of each unvisited node.

First, we calculate the MGS distance for each unvisited node using Algorithm 1. This distance reflects the balance between being close to the current node and having a low MGS distance.

Next, we calculate the current distances and destination distances for each unvisited node like in Algorithm 2. The current distances measure the direct distance from the current node to each unvisited node, while the destination distances measure the direct distance from each unvisited node to the destination node.

Then, we calculate the degree centrality for each unvisited node. Degree centrality represents the number of neighbors each unvisited node has, indicating the level of connectivity.

Finally, we combine the MGS distance, the current distances, the destination distances, and the degree centrality into a score for each unvisited node. We then select the node with the highest score as the next node to visit and return it.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    direct_distance = distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node]

    mgs_distance = {}

    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        node_distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]

        weight = 1
        for neighbor in unvisited_nodes:
            if neighbor != node and neighbor in distance_matrix[node]:
                weight += 1

        mgs_distance[node] = direct_distance / (node_distance * weight)

    scores = {}
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        scores[node] = mgs_distance[node] / distance_matrix[current_node][node]

    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]

    # Calculate degree centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    degree_centralities = nx.degree_centrality(graph)

    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the factors
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        scores[node] += current_distances[node] - 0.5 * destination_distances[node] + 0.2 * degree_centralities[node]

    nxt_node = max(scores, key=scores.get)

    return nxt_node
```
