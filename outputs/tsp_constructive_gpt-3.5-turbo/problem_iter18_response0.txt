Code description: 
The proposed algorithm focuses on incorporating additional factors that can improve the selection of the next node. It introduces a novel approach that considers the balance between the distance from the current node to the unvisited nodes and the distance from the destination node to the unvisited nodes. By taking into account both factors, the algorithm aims to find a better next node that can lead to a more optimal solution.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate combined score based on a weighted sum of the two factors
    score = current_distances - 0.5 * destination_distances
    
    # Find the node with the smallest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmin(score)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
