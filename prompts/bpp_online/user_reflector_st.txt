Below are two priority functions that help solve online bin packing problems.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]
{worse_code}

[Better code]
{better_code}

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 50 words.
