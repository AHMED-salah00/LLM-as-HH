Code description: The proposed algorithm, named "Greedy with Clustering and Prioritization" (GCP), selects the next node based on a combination of greedy strategy, clustering, and prioritization. 

First, the algorithm calculates the average distance between each unvisited node and its closest neighbor. This information is used to determine the clusters of nodes, with each cluster containing a set of nodes that are close to each other. 

Next, the algorithm prioritizes the clusters based on their size. It assigns a priority score to each cluster, with larger clusters receiving higher scores. 

Finally, the algorithm selects the next node to visit based on the clusters' priority scores. It chooses a node from the highest priority cluster.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using Greedy with Clustering and Prioritization heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    # Calculate the average distance between each unvisited node and its closest neighbor
    closest_neighbor_distances = np.min(distance_matrix[unvisited_nodes][:, unvisited_nodes], axis=1)
    
    # Determine the clusters of nodes based on the average distance
    clusters = [[]]
    cluster_indices = []
    cluster_index = 0
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        if closest_neighbor_distances[node] > np.percentile(closest_neighbor_distances, 75):
            clusters.append([])
            cluster_index += 1
        
        clusters[cluster_index].append(node)
        cluster_indices.append(cluster_index)
    
    # Prioritize clusters based on their size
    cluster_sizes = np.array([len(cluster) for cluster in clusters])
    priority_scores = cluster_sizes / np.sum(cluster_sizes)
    
    # Select a node from the highest priority cluster as the next node to visit
    max_priority_cluster_index = np.argmax(priority_scores)
    cluster_nodes = clusters[max_priority_cluster_index]
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(cluster_nodes)
    
    return nxt_node
```
Note: The algorithm uses np.percentile to determine the threshold for clustering. In this implementation, it considers nodes with distances higher than the 75th percentile as potential cluster boundaries, but you can adjust this threshold to fit your specific problem.
