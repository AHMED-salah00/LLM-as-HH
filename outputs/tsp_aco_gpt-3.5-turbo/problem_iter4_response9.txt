Code description: 
My modified algorithm aims to improve the effectiveness of the scoring function by incorporating additional features into the heuristics. Specifically, I introduce two new features - the minimum edge weight and the degree centrality.

To calculate the minimum edge weight, I find the smallest non-zero distance for each node.

The degree centrality of a node measures its connectedness to other nodes. To calculate this, I compute the average degree of the neighbors for each node.

Finally, I combine these two new features with the existing features (inverse distance, hop count, and node degree).

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import minimum_spanning_tree
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the average distance of connected nodes for each node
    connected_nodes_avg_distance = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1) / (n_nodes - 1)

    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (inverse_distance_matrix * connected_nodes_avg_distance[:, np.newaxis] * hop_count * edge_scores) / (edge_scores**2)

    # Calculate node degree
    node_degree = np.sum(distance_matrix <= (n_nodes-1), axis=1)
    
    # Multiply the node degree with heuristic measures
    heuristics *= node_degree[:, np.newaxis]

    # Calculate the minimum edge weight for each node
    min_edge_weight = np.min(distance_matrix[np.nonzero(distance_matrix)], axis=1)

    # Calculate degree centrality
    degree_centrality = np.zeros(n_nodes)
    for node in range(n_nodes):
        neighbors = np.where(distance_matrix[node] != 0)[0]
        if len(neighbors) > 0:
            degree_centrality[node] = np.mean(node_degree[neighbors])
    
    # Multiply the minimum edge weight and degree centrality with heuristic measures
    heuristics *= min_edge_weight[:, np.newaxis]
    heuristics *= degree_centrality[:, np.newaxis]

    return heuristics
```
