Code description: 

In this code, I will combine the best aspects of both algorithms to design a novel selecting-next-node function. This function will consider both the shortest edge distance and the attractiveness of each unvisited node based on its distance to the destination node. The function will probabilistically select the next node to visit, balancing exploration and exploitation.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    alpha = 1.0
    beta = 1.0
    
    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix[current_node])
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_node = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node, destination_node]
        attractiveness[node] = (distance_to_destination / (distance_to_node**alpha))**beta
    
    # Normalize attractiveness
    total_attractiveness = np.sum(attractiveness)
    attractiveness /= total_attractiveness
    
    # Calculate shortest edge distances for the unvisited nodes
    shortest_edge_distances = np.min(distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)], axis=0)
    
    # Combine attractiveness and shortest edge distances
    combined_scores = attractiveness + shortest_edge_distances
    
    # Find the index of the node with the highest combined score
    max_score_idx = np.argmax(combined_scores)
    
    # Get the node with the highest combined score
    next_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[max_score_idx]
    
    return next_node
```
