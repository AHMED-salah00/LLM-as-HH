Code description: 
The improved scoring function incorporates several factors to create a more comprehensive heuristic measure for each edge in the TSP instance. It combines the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, incorporating node centrality measures, the ratio of distance to average distance, degree centrality, edge importance, and connectivity information. By considering multiple factors, the heuristic measures aim to capture various aspects of each edge's potential usefulness.

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns

    heuristics: np.ndarray

            common_neighbors = len(set(np.where(distance_matrix[i] > 0)[0]) & set(np.where(distance_matrix[j] > 0)[0]))
            connectivity[i, j] = 1 / ((degrees[i] + degrees[j]) * (common_neighbors + 1))
    
    # Calculate the heuristic measures
    heuristics = edge_importance * node_centrality[:, np.newaxis] * connectivity * total_centrality[:, np.newaxis]
    
    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```

Note: In this improved scoring function, I have incorporated node centrality measures (degree centrality and closeness centrality), the ratio of distance to average distance, degree centrality, edge importance, and connectivity information to create a more comprehensive scoring function. The heuristics are then normalized to sum up to 1.
