You begin by giving a concise description of your code, followed by the code itself. **NOTE**: Your code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- You can try designs like node clustering, look-ahead mechanisms, and local search.
- You can try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select a node. **Do NOT use Nearest Neighbor heuristic**.
