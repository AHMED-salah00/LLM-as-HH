Code description: 

In this algorithm, we will modify the selection process to prioritize nodes that have a higher improvement in path length. We will ignore the factors of distance and the number of unvisited neighbors. This modification is based on the assumption that nodes with higher improvement in path length will likely lead to a better overall solution.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_improvement = -np.inf
    max_improvement_nodes = []
    
    # Calculate the improvement in path length for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        current_distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        destination_distance = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        improvement = current_distance + destination_distance - distance_matrix[current_node][destination_node]
        
        # Update max improvement if improvement is higher
        if improvement > max_improvement:
            max_improvement = improvement
            max_improvement_nodes = [node]
        elif improvement == max_improvement:
            max_improvement_nodes.append(node)
    
    # Randomly select one of the nodes with the highest improvement
    nxt_node = np.random.choice(max_improvement_nodes)
    
    return nxt_node
```
