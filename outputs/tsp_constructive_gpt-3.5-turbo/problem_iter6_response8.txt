Code description: In this algorithm, I propose a novel approach to select the next node based on a combination of the attractiveness and diversity of the unvisited nodes. Attractiveness is calculated using the approach from Algorithm 2, while diversity is calculated as the difference between the distance from the current node to an unvisited node and the average distance from the current node to all unvisited nodes. The node with the maximum combined value of attractiveness and diversity is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize parameters
    pheromone_matrix = np.full_like(distance_matrix, 0.01)  # Initialize pheromone matrix with small values

    # Calculate distances from current node to unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Normalize distances
    norm_distances = distances / np.max(distances)

    # Calculate attractiveness of each unvisited node
    attractiveness = (1 - norm_distances) + pheromone_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate diversity of each unvisited node
    avg_distance = np.mean(distances)
    diversity = distances - avg_distance
    
    # Combine attractiveness and diversity
    combined_values = attractiveness + diversity
    
    # Select next node based on maximum combined value
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(combined_values)]

    return nxt_node
```

Note: In this code, I have extended the Algorithm 2 by introducing a measure of diversity. The diversity measure takes into account the difference between the distance from the current node to an unvisited node and the average distance from the current node to all unvisited nodes. This allows the algorithm to balance between selecting nodes that are both attractive and diverse.
