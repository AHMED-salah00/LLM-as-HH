Code description: The crossover algorithm I propose selects the next node based on a combination of factors including the distance to the node, the distance to the destination node, and the number of unvisited neighbors. It calculates a score for each unvisited node using these factors, and selects the node with the highest score as the next node to visit. 

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    weight1 = 0.3
    weight2 = 0.3
    weight3 = 0.4
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_to_current = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        distance_to_destination = distance_matrix[node][destination_node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = np.sum(distance_matrix[node,:] > 0)
        
        score = weight1 * (1 / (distance_to_current+1)) + weight2 * (1 / (distance_to_destination+1)) + weight3 * num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
