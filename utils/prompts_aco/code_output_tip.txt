Some helpful tips:
(1) Do not modify the function signature.
(2) Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
(3) You write novel algorithms instead of using classic and greedy ones. For example, DO NOT simply use the inverse of distances as heuristic measures.
