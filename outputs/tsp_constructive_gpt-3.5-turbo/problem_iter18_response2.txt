Code description: 

To improve upon the existing algorithms, I propose a new algorithm that selects the next node based on a combination of attractiveness, closeness centrality, and the number of unvisited neighbors. The rationale behind this is to strike a balance between selecting nodes that are close to the current node, have a high centrality, and have many unvisited neighbors.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    # Calculate the attractiveness for each unvisited node
    attractiveness = distance_matrix[:, destination_node] - distance_matrix[:, current_node]
    
    # Calculate the closeness centrality of each unvisited node
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(nx.Graph(distance_matrix))
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(distance_matrix[node] > 0)))
        
        # Calculate the combined score based on attractiveness, closeness centrality, and number of unvisited neighbors
        score = attractiveness[node] + closeness_centrality[node] + num_unvisited_neighbors
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
