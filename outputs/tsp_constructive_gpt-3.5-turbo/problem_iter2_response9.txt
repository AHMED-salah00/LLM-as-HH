Code description: The modified algorithm is called "Minimum Distance to Destination" heuristic. It selects the next node to visit based on the minimum distance from the current node to the destination node. The node that has the shortest distance to the destination node is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes using the Minimum Distance to Destination heuristic.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """
    
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Calculate the distances from the current node to each unvisited node
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node]
    
    # Select the node with the minimum distance to the destination node
    nxt_node = np.argmin(distances)
    
    return nxt_node
```
The modified algorithm selects the next node to visit based on the minimum distance to the destination node. This approach aims to move the solution closer to the destination node at each step, potentially leading to a shorter overall path. By focusing on the distance to the destination node, the algorithm may avoid unnecessary detours and converge towards a more optimal solution.
