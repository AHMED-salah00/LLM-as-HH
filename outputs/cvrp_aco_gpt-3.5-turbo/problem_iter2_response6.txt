Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will consider the distance, demand, and capacity of nodes in a weighted manner. I will modify the weight coefficients for distance, demand, and remaining capacity to find a better balance. Additionally, I will include the remaining capacity of the vehicle as a factor in the heuristic measure.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Initialize heuristics matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Set weight coefficients for distance, demand, and remaining capacity
    distance_weight = 0.3
    demand_weight = 0.4
    capacity_weight = 0.3

    # Set a very large number for diagonal elements of distance matrix
    np.fill_diagonal(distance_matrix, np.inf)

    # Calculate heuristic measures for each edge
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(i+1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_sum = demands[i] + demands[j]
            remaining_cap = CAPACITY - (demands[i] + demands[j])

            # Calculate heuristic measure
            heuristics[i, j] = (distance_weight * distance) + (demand_weight * demand_sum) - (capacity_weight * remaining_cap)

    # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
    heuristics += np.tril(heuristics.T, -1)
    
    return heuristics
```

In the modified code, I have adjusted the weight coefficients to improve the balance between the distance, demand, and remaining capacity factors. I have set the distance weight to 0.3, demand weight to 0.4, and capacity weight to 0.3. Additionally, I have updated the calculation of remaining capacity by considering the sum of demands for the current edge. Finally, I have subtracted the capacity weight from the heuristic measure to give higher scores to edges with lower remaining capacity.
