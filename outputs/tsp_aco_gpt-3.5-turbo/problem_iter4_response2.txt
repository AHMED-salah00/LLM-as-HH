Code description: 
In this improved scoring function, I propose to incorporate the concepts of hop count, edge centrality score, and node degree into the heuristic measures. First, I calculate the hop count between nodes to prioritize edges that connect nodes that are closer in terms of hops. Then, I compute the centrality score for each node by summing the inverses of distances to other nodes and normalize it to obtain the centrality score. Next, I calculate the node degree, which represents the number of edges connected to each node, as an additional measure of importance. Finally, I combine the hop count, centrality score, and node degree to get the final heuristic measures for each edge.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the centrality score for each node
    centrality_score = 1 / (1 + node_scores)
    
    # Repeat the centrality score for each edge
    edge_centrality_scores = np.repeat(centrality_score[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the node degree
    node_degree = np.sum(distance_matrix <= (n_nodes -1), axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge
    heuristics = (hop_count + 1) * (1 / edge_centrality_scores) * node_degree[:, np.newaxis]
    
    return heuristics
```
```
