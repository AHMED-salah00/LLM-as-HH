Some helpful tips:
- Adhere to the function signature.
- Import necessary packages. Except for importing packages, you should write everything inside the function.
- We only construct a solution once, so introducing stochasticity is not helpful.
- You write novel algorithms instead of using classic and greedy ones. For example, DO NOT write Nearest Neighbor heuristic!
