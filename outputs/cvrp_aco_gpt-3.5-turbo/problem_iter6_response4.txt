Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the distance, demand, position, load balance, clustering, and degree centrality factors to assign heuristic measures to each edge. I will assign appropriate weights to each factor based on their relative importance. To further improve efficiency, I will initialize the heuristics matrix outside of the loops and use vectorized operations whenever possible.

```

With this improved scoring function, we consider a combination of factors such as distance, demand, position, load balance, clustering, and degree centrality to assign heuristic measures to each edge. The weights for each factor are assigned based on their relative importance. We also initialize the heuristics matrix outside the loops for efficiency and utilize vectorized operations whenever possible.
