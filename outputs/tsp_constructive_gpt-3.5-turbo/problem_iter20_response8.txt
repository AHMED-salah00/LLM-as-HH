Code description: 
The code aims to select the next node based on a combination of distance and the average distance to unvisited nodes. This is done by calculating a score for each unvisited node that takes into account both factors. 

The distance score is calculated by dividing the distance to the current node by the maximum distance in the distance matrix. This normalizes the distances and ensures that all nodes have a score between 0 and 1. 

The average distance score is calculated by summing the distances from the unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes and dividing it by the number of unvisited nodes. This provides an indication of how far the unvisited node is from the remaining unvisited nodes.

Finally, the two scores are combined using a trade-off parameter, which determines the relative importance of distance and average distance. The node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    trade_off = 0.5
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node][node]
        
        # Distance score
        distance_score = distance / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        # Average distance score
        avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix[node][list(unvisited_nodes)])
        avg_distance_score = avg_distance / np.max(distance_matrix)
        
        # Calculate the weighted score
        score = trade_off * distance_score + (1 - trade_off) * avg_distance_score
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
