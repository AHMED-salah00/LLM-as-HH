Code description: In this code, I propose a novel approach for selecting the next node to visit. The algorithm takes into account the distance from the current node, the destination node, and the unvisited nodes, and assigns a score to each unvisited node based on these distances. The node with the highest score is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Calculate distance from current node to each unvisited node
    current_distances = distance_matrix[current_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance from destination node to each unvisited node
    destination_distances = distance_matrix[destination_node, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate distance between each pair of unvisited nodes
    unvisited_distances = distance_matrix[list(unvisited_nodes)][:, list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Calculate the average distance from each unvisited node to all other unvisited nodes
    avg_unvisited_distances = unvisited_distances.sum(axis=1) / (len(unvisited_nodes) - 1)
    
    # Calculate the score for each unvisited node
    scores = 0.5 * current_distances - 0.3 * destination_distances - 0.2 * avg_unvisited_distances
    
    # Find the node with the highest score
    nxt_node = list(unvisited_nodes)[np.argmax(scores)]
    
    return nxt_node
```
The proposed algorithm assigns a score to each unvisited node by combining the current distance, the destination distance, and the average distance to all other unvisited nodes. The algorithm aims to balance proximity to the current node (to minimize travel distance) and the destination node (to optimize the overall route) while also considering the average distance to other unvisited nodes (to avoid selecting nodes that are too close to each other). The node with the highest score is chosen as the next node to visit.
