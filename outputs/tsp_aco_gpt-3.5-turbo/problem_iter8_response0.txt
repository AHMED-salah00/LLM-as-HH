Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will combine the ideas from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. I will calculate the inverse distances of each edge from Algorithm 2 and incorporate the degree of nodes from Algorithm 1. The idea is to prioritize edges that have a short distance and connect to nodes with a lower degree, indicating that they are less connected and potentially easier to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The heuristic measures indicate how promising is each edge before actually solving this TSP instance.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes), where diagonal elements are set to inf.
    
    Returns
    -------
    heuristics: np.ndarray
        The heuristic measures of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes) for all edges. 
    """
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Calculate the inverse distances
    inverse_distances = 1 / distance_matrix
    np.fill_diagonal(inverse_distances, 0)
    
    # Compute the degree of each node
    node_degrees = np.sum(distance_matrix != np.inf, axis=1)
    
    # Initialize the heuristic measures matrix
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    # Calculate the heuristic measure for each edge
    for i in range(n_nodes):
        for j in range(n_nodes):
            if i != j:
                heuristics[i, j] = inverse_distances[i, j] / (1 + node_degrees[j])
    
    # Normalize the heuristic measures so that they sum up to 1
    heuristics /= np.sum(heuristics)
    
    return heuristics
```
