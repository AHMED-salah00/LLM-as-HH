Code description: 
In this novel scoring function, I propose to combine the hop count measure from Algorithm 1 and the edge centrality score from Algorithm 2. I calculate the hop count between nodes to prioritize edges that connect nodes that are closer in terms of hops. Then, I compute the centrality score for each node by summing the inverses of distances to other nodes and normalize it to get the centrality score. Finally, I combine the hop count and centrality score to obtain the final heuristic measures for each edge.

```python
import numpy as np

def scoring_function(distance_matrix):
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    # Compute the inverse of the distance matrix
    inverse_distance_matrix = np.where(distance_matrix != 0, 1 / distance_matrix, 0)
    
    # Compute the hop count between nodes
    hop_count = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes), dtype=int)
    for hop in range(1, n_nodes):
        hop_count += (distance_matrix <= hop)
    
    # Compute the sum of distances to other nodes for each node
    node_scores = np.sum(inverse_distance_matrix, axis=1)
    
    # Repeat the node scores for each edge
    edge_scores = np.repeat(node_scores[:, np.newaxis], n_nodes, axis=1)
    
    # Compute the heuristic measures for each edge by combining hop count and centrality score
    heuristics = (hop_count + 1) * (1 / node_scores[:, np.newaxis])
    
    return heuristics
```
