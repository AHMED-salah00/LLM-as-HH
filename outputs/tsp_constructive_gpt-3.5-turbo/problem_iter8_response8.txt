Code description: The proposed code aims to modify the current algorithm by introducing a novel criterion based on the available nodes' distances and the number of remaining unvisited nodes. In this modified algorithm, the nodes are ranked based on a combination of the reciprocal of their distances from the current node and the number of unvisited neighboring nodes. The node with the highest rank is selected as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Initialize variables
    max_rank = -np.inf
    selected_node = None
    
    # Iterate over unvisited nodes
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        # Calculate the distance between current node and unvisited node
        distance = distance_matrix[current_node, node]
        
        # Calculate the reciprocal of the distance
        reciprocal_distance = 1 / distance if distance > 0 else np.inf
        
        # Calculate the number of unvisited neighboring nodes
        unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(np.where(distance_matrix[node] > 0)[0]))
        
        # Calculate the rank based on distance and number of unvisited neighbors
        rank = reciprocal_distance + unvisited_neighbors
        
        # Update the selected node if the rank is higher
        if rank > max_rank:
            max_rank = rank
            selected_node = node
    
    nxt_node = selected_node
    return nxt_node
```
