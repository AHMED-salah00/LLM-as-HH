Code description: 

This code selects the next node to visit based on a combination of attractiveness, number of unvisited neighbors, and closeness centrality. 

The efficiency of the code can be improved by avoiding redundant calculations of the distance matrix and closeness centrality. Instead of calculating them in advance for every unvisited node, we can calculate them only for the current and destination nodes. 

We can then use these pre-calculated values to determine the attractiveness and number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node. 

To select the next node, we calculate a score for each unvisited node based on the pre-calculated values and select the node with the highest score. In case of a tie, we select the node with the highest closeness centrality.

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Pre-calculate distance from current and destination nodes
    distances_current = distance_matrix[current_node]
    distances_destination = distance_matrix[destination_node]
    
    # Calculate attractiveness and number of unvisited neighbors for each unvisited node
    attractiveness_dict = {}
    num_unvisited_neighbors_dict = {}
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        distance_current = distances_current[node]
        distance_destination = distances_destination[node]
        attractiveness = distance_destination - distance_current
        attractiveness_dict[node] = attractiveness
        
        num_unvisited_neighbors = len(unvisited_nodes.intersection(set(np.nonzero(distance_matrix[node])[0])))
        num_unvisited_neighbors_dict[node] = num_unvisited_neighbors
    
    # Calculate closeness centrality for each unvisited node
    graph = nx.Graph(distance_matrix)
    closeness_centrality = nx.closeness_centrality(graph)
    closeness_centrality_dict = {node: closeness_centrality[node] for node in unvisited_nodes}
    
    # Select the next node based on attractiveness, number of unvisited neighbors, and closeness centrality
    max_score = -np.inf
    nxt_node = None
    
    for node in unvisited_nodes:
        score = attractiveness_dict[node] + num_unvisited_neighbors_dict[node] + closeness_centrality_dict[node]
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            nxt_node = node
        elif score == max_score:
            if closeness_centrality_dict[node] > closeness_centrality_dict[nxt_node]:
                nxt_node = node
    
    return nxt_node
```
