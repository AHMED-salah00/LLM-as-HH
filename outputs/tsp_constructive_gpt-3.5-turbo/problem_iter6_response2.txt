Code description: 
The code below proposes a modified version of Algorithm 2 that incorporates the idea of balancing exploration and exploitation. The modified algorithm introduces a randomness factor that allows for the exploration of different paths while still prioritizing nodes that are closer to the current and destination nodes. 

The modified algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize an empty list called scores to store the scores of each unvisited node.
2. Iterate through each unvisited node.
3. For each unvisited node, calculate the score by summing the distance from the current node to the unvisited node, the distance from the unvisited node to the destination node, and a random number from a uniform distribution.
4. Append the score to the scores list.
5. Find the index of the minimum score in the scores list.
6. Return the unvisited node at the same index as the minimum score in the scores list. 

The introduction of randomness in the scoring mechanism allows for the exploration of different paths, which can potentially lead to finding better solutions.
