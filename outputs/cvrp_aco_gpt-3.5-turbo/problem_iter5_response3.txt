Code description: In this improved scoring function, I will incorporate both the clustering factor and the degree centrality factor into the scoring calculation. I will adjust the weights of each factor based on their importance and relevance to the problem. Additionally, I will initialize the heuristics matrix outside the loop for efficiency.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import networkx as nx

def scoring_function(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, CAPACITY: int) -> np.ndarray:
    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]
    
    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)
    
    heuristics = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    
    distance_weight = 0.45  # Weight for the distance factor
    demand_weight = 0.25  # Weight for the demand factor
    clustering_weight = 0.15  # Weight for the clustering factor
    centrality_weight = 0.15  # Weight for the centrality factor
    
    # Calculate clustering factor
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(distance_matrix[1:, 1:])
    
    cluster_distances = np.zeros((n_nodes, n_nodes))
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            if cluster_labels[i-1] == cluster_labels[j-1]:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = distance_matrix[i, j]
                cluster_distances[j, i] = distance_matrix[j, i]
            else:
                cluster_distances[i, j] = max_distance
                cluster_distances[j, i] = max_distance
    
    # Calculate degree centrality of each node
    G = nx.from_numpy_array(distance_matrix)
    centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
    
    # Calculate heuristic measures
    for i in range(1, n_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, n_nodes):
            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]
            demand_ratio = demands[j] / CAPACITY
            cluster_distance = cluster_distances[i, j]
            
            if demand_ratio > 1:
                heuristics[i, j] = 0
            else:
                inverted_distance = 1 / distance
                clustering_factor = np.exp(-cluster_distance / max_distance)
                centrality_factor = centrality[j]
                
                heuristics[i, j] = distance_weight * inverted_distance + demand_weight * demand_ratio + clustering_weight * clustering_factor + centrality_weight * centrality_factor
            
            # Symmetrically set heuristics for the lower triangle of the matrix
            heuristics[j, i] = heuristics[i, j]
    
    return heuristics

This improved scoring function combines the best features from Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. It incorporates the clustering factor that identifies nodes belonging to the same cluster and assigns higher scores to edges that connect these nodes. It also includes the degree centrality factor, which measures the importance of each node based on its connectivity. The weights of each factor can be adjusted based on their relevance to the problem and desired focus.
