Code description: 

In this code, I propose a new algorithm called "Node Clustering" to select the next node. The idea is to cluster the unvisited nodes based on their distances to the current node, and then select a node from the cluster that is closest to the destination node.

I will start by calculating the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes. Then, I will find the median distance and partition the unvisited nodes into two clusters: one cluster for nodes with distances less than or equal to the median, and another cluster for nodes with distances greater than the median.

Next, I will calculate the distances from the nodes in the cluster with smaller distances to the destination node. Then, I will select the node with the smallest distance to the destination node as the next node to visit.

Finally, I will return the next node as the output of the function.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    """
    Select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    current_node : int
        The current node.
    destination_node : int
        The destination node to return to.
    unvisited_nodes : set
        The set of unvisited nodes.
    distance_matrix : np.ndarray
        The distance matrix of shape (n_nodes, n_nodes).
    
    Returns
    -------
    nxt_node : int
        The next node to visit.
    """

    # Calculate distances from current node to all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Find the median distance
    median_distance = np.median(distances)
    
    # Partition unvisited nodes into two clusters based on distances
    cluster1 = set(node for node in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[current_node][node] <= median_distance)
    cluster2 = unvisited_nodes - cluster1
    
    # Calculate distances from cluster1 nodes to destination node
    cluster1_distances = distance_matrix[list(cluster1), destination_node]
    
    # Find the index of the node with the smallest distance to destination node in cluster1
    min_distance_idx = np.argmin(cluster1_distances)
    
    # Get the node with the smallest distance to destination node in cluster1
    next_node = list(cluster1)[min_distance_idx]
    
    return next_node
```
