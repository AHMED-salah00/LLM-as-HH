Code description: 

The code below proposes a novel selecting-next-node function called "Randomized Shortest Edge". This function selects the next node to visit by considering the distance between the current node and the unvisited nodes. However, instead of always selecting the node with the shortest edge, this function adds a random element to the selection process.

Randomization can be beneficial to exploration, especially in cases where multiple nodes have similar distances from the current node. By occasionally choosing a node with a slightly longer edge, the algorithm can potentially discover new and potentially better paths.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Get the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes.
2. Calculate the minimum distance among these distances.
3. Select all the nodes that have the minimum distance and store them in a list.
4. Randomly select a node from the list of nodes with the minimum distance.
5. Return the selected node as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    # Get the distances from the current node to all unvisited nodes
    distances = distance_matrix[current_node][list(unvisited_nodes)]
    
    # Find the minimum distance
    min_distance = np.min(distances)
    
    # Find the nodes with the minimum distance
    min_distance_nodes = [node for node in unvisited_nodes if distance_matrix[current_node][node] == min_distance]
    
    # Select a random node from the nodes with minimum distance
    next_node = np.random.choice(min_distance_nodes)
    
    return next_node
```

This code randomizes the selection process by selecting one node randomly from the set of nodes that have the minimum distance from the current node. This allows for exploration and the possibility of discovering new paths.
