Code description: This code implements a selecting-next-node function using a novel constructive heuristic called "Random Plus". The idea behind this heuristic is to randomly select the next node to visit from the unvisited nodes. The function randomly selects a node from the set of unvisited nodes and returns it as the next node to visit.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def select_next_node(current_node: int, destination_node: int, unvisited_nodes: set, distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> int:
    nxt_node = random.choice(list(unvisited_nodes))
    
    return nxt_node
```
```python
